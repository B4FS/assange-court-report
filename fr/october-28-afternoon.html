                <p><strong>Assange lawyers question validity of US assurances</strong></p>

<p>US government assurances about the treatment of Julian Assange, if he is
extradited, are  “conditional, qualified and aspirational,” the High
Court has been told.</p>

<p>Mark Summers QC, who is part of the Wikileaks founder’s defence team,
was commenting on a new US Government statement that their intention was
not to imprison Assange under Special Administrative Measures (SAMs) or
be placed in a high security Supermax prison.</p>

<p>He asked the two judges to consider that the assurances had only
appeared at this appeal hearing, “Why are they allowed to change their
case after two years with a mentally vulnerable defendant in custody?”
he asked, adding “if there was no risk of SAMS they could have made a
firm commitment not to impose them, which they have not. This might give
us an indication of their intentions,” he said.</p>

<p>“There are genuine questions about their trustworthiness,” he said.</p>

<p>Summers also drew attention to a number of statements presented to the
original hearings in the case, which led to a district judge rejecting
the US extradition request, noting that while being central to the
government’s case, Assistant United States Attorney Gordon Kromberg
declined to take to the witness stand and be cross-examined.</p>

<p>Summers suggested that Krombeg’s statements do not rule out SAMS or
Supermax prisons, but instead argued that “they are ok.“ He quoted
Kromberg’s statements where he had said prisoners in a Supermax jail
were not in solitary confinement as they could “shout to the prisoners
in the cells beside and above them.”</p>

<p>“This assurance takes us nowhere at all,” Summers said.</p>

<p>Summers said that the CIA has classified Wikileaks as a “hostile
non-state intelligence entity,” and according to credible media reports
wanted “vengence” over the leaks from the CIA to the extent that they
had considered kidnapping, or even assassinating Assange.</p>

<p>Sommers also noted the Spanish extradition case of a Mr Mendoza in which
US prosecutors had guaranteed that if he was extradited and convicted he
would be sent back to Spain to serve his sentence. He was duly convicted
and applied for transfer but this was refused by the Department of
Justice. Summers said that prosecutors could assert what they wished,
but any transfer would ultimately not be their decision.</p>

<p>Moving onto possible sentences, the barrister told the court, “Every
single lawyer, including experienced judges,  who have looked at this
say these guidelines would lead to a de facto life sentence… which he
would spend in complete isolation.”</p>

<p>Responding on behalf of the US Government, James Lewis QC told the court
that Mr Mendoza was eventually returned to Spain to serve his sentence,
“Every diplomatic assurance was honoured,” he said. The barrister
submitted that defence arguments about Assange spending his life in a
supermax prison under SAMs were “entirely speculative.” adding that the
conditions in these met the requirements of Article 3 of the European
Convention Of Human Rights.</p>

<p>Lewis then dismissed the defence argument that the assurances had come
too late.  “We could start the extradition process all over again, with
the assurances,” he said, noting that it was usual only to provide these
after a court had expressed concerns.</p>

<p>“These are decided at the highest level, they are not dished out like
smarties,” he said adding, “They are a responsible step for an
extradition partner to make.”</p>

<p>Lewis continued by saying “My learned friends  have completely shifted
their ground,” reminding the court that the US government had pledged to
allow Assange to serve any sentence in Australia so there was no
prospect of him spending the rest of his life in a Supermax prison.</p>

<p>Lewis then ended his submission.</p>

<p>The two judges, The Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett and Lord Justice
Holroyd thanked the parties and retired to consider their decision.</p>
