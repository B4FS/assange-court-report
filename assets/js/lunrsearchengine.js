    "body": "2024/07/24 - Assange Court Report website archived Material on this website remains free for all to use - refer to the permissions page for details on licensing and attribution In early 2020, Blueprint for Free Speech set up the Assange Court Report as part of our Bridges for Media Freedom project. Our intention was to produce a series of concise and objective daily reports from WikiLeaks Publisher Julian Assange’s extradition hearings - a historically important legal case for freedom of expression. Our reporting, which settled into twice-daily reports from court and accompanying photographs of the scenes outside, took in the initial extradition hearing in February and September 2020, the first appeal to the High Court in October 2021 and the application for a second appeal in Feburary 2024. That appeal, which was due to be heard in July 2024, was superseded by the plea deal that enabled Julian Assange to enter Australia as a free man in June that year. Along the way, we also covered a series of procedural and case management hearings and published many of the legal documents from the case. Much of this material has not been well-recorded elsewhere. From the start of the project, we intended these reports and images to be freely used by others. This remains the case and we hope this archive will prove useful for those who want to understand how the legal arguments in this case proceeded on a day-to-day basis. For licensing and attribution information, please see here. Current dynamics in the media industry have made the economics of regular court reporting challenging. Open justice demands that the public is able to follow events in court, particularly when cases have an impact on issues of genuine public importance. In this case in particular, much of which took place during the Covid-19 epidemic, public access to the courtroom was often extremely difficult to secure. We hope that the Assange Court Report stands as an example of how civil society can step in to remedy gaps in the contemporaneous reporting provided by commercial media. Though much of the work on the Court Report was uncredited, at this point we want to acknowledge and thank our key contributors. Prime among them was James Doleman, an exemplary reporter and a good friend, who authored all of the reporting on this website through the first set of appeals in 2022. James’ passing in July 2023 was a great loss to British journalism. Later reporting was supplied by Sara Chessa, who has been closely involved in this project from its inception. We would also like to thank Guy Smallman, who provided much of the photography featured on this website. Photographs from the initial extradition hearings at Woolwich Magistrates’ Court were taken by Jekaterina Saveljeva. Any inquiries about the project can be directed to us at contact@bridgesforfreedom. media "

    "body": "2024/06/25 - Julian Assange freed from Belmarsh prison after agreeing plea deal After spending over five years incarcerated in the UK’s high security Belmarsh prison, WikiLeaks Publisher Julian Assange has been freed from the threat of prosecution in the United States. WikiLeaks confirmed that Assange had been released from Belmarsh prison on the morning of on Monday 24 June and boarded a plane out of the UK at 5pm local time. There has as yet been no official statement from the US Department of Justice. But, according to reports, Assange has agreed to plead guilty to one of the eighteen felony charges he faced, one of conspiring with whistleblower Chelsea Manning to obtain national defence information. Court documents from the US District Court in the Northern Mariana Islands in the Pacific suggest that Julian Assange may make a court appearance there to confirm the plea deal. According to reports, Assange will then return to Australia, a country he has not set foot in since 2010. Over the course of this case and several years of extradition hearings in the UK – which we have been following closely at Blueprint for Free Speech – we have repeatedly raised the alarm about what the US prosecution meant for the day-to-day work of investigative journalists working with their sources. Many of those questions about the future of national security journalism in the US and beyond will need to be asked with even greater urgency in the wake of today’s news. However, there is no doubt that Julian Assange’s release from prison will delight the many individuals and organisations who have been working hard for this result for years, both in public and behind the scenes. In addition to our public courtroom coverage, Blueprint launched a campaign for Julian Assange’s pardon in 2021. We would like to thank everyone who has been part of our efforts – and everyone else’s – to avoid the catastrophe of a US prosecution of Julian Assange. Today’s news is enormous for Assange and his family, but it also belongs to all of us. "

    "title": "High Court finds US assurances insufficient and grants permission to appeal against extradition",
    "body": "2024/05/20 - High Court finds US assurances insufficient and grants permission to appeal against extradition The High Court decided on Monday to grant WikiLeaks Publisher Julian Assange permission to appeal against his potential extradition to the United States, where he faces an unprecedented set of charges related to WikiLeaks’ publications between 2010 and 2012. In March, the High Court had ruled that Assange would have been granted leave to appeal only if the United States were unable to provide the court with valid assurances on two separate issues: that there was no risk of the death penalty being sought in his case; and that he would be able to rely on the First Amendment as a legal defence without being discriminated against on the basis of his nationality. Julian Assange did not appear during today’s hearing for health reasons. Edward Fitzgerald KC, for Assange, stated in front of the judges, Victoria Sharp and Jeremy Johnson, that the assurance provided by the US Government on the death penalty was accepted by his client, since it is unambiguous and would be binding for the US courts.  The discussion then turned to the second assurance. “It does not promise that the applicant can rely on the First amendment, it merely saysthat he can raise and seek to rely on it,” Fitzgerald said. Fitzgerald argued that a critical absence in the language of the assurance was any obligation on the prosecution not to argue that First Amendment rights should not apply. This was particularly important since the suggestion had originally come from the affidavit of a senior prosecutor for the Eastern District of Virginia, Gordon Kromberg. Furthermore, even if the assurance had contained this language, it was a settled constitutional point in the US that no assurance could bind a federal court. Mark Summers KC, also for Assange, noted that, given the language of the UK Extradition Act, US prosecutors could argue that its non-discriminations provisions did not apply given that “nationality as a concept is somehow narrower than citizenship. ” Summers stated that such argument is “plain wrong when one looks at the Refugee Convention… British citizenship is one of many forms of being a national and one can’t be a citizen without being a national. ” James Lewis KC then rose on behalf of the US Government. He said the law, including European Convention on Human Rights, only protects “responsible journalism. ” The US Government held that Assange may not be entitled to First Amendment protections, but this was on the basis of the manner of his publications, rather than his nationality: “no-one, neither US Citizens nor foreign citizens, are entitled to rely on the First Amendment in relation to publication of illegally obtained national defence information giving the names of innocent sources to their grave and imminent risk of harm. ” Mark Summers responded to the US assertion that citizenship is just one of the factors involved in deciding whether First Amendment rights apply. “The fact remains, and the US accepts it, that non-US citizenship is one of three relevant factors. And it is an important factor in this case. ” Ben Watson, representing the UK Home Secretary, who is also a respondent in this appeal, asked the judges to dismiss the appeal in relation to the role of the then Home Secretary in authorising Julian’s extradition. The ruling came at the end of the hearing. The judges said the US submissions on non-discrimination were not sufficient and granted the WikiLeaks publisher permission to appeal in relation to the points on freedom of speech and nationality. A full appeal hearing will follow. The parties have been given time until May 24 to submit a proposed outline for how the hearing will proceed. "

    "body": "2024/02/21 - Lack of extradition safeguards revealed in final session of Assange hearing The hearing that could mark WikiLeaks Publisher Julian Assange’s final opportunity to oppose his extradition to the United States closed on Wednesday with no announcement of a date for the judges’ decision. During the afternoon session, the lack of protections Assange would face in the case of extradition became the subject of a series of probing questions from one of the judges who will determine that decision. A lawyer representing the Secretary of State for the Home Department (SSHD) told the court that the latter “has limited powers to prevent extradition in this case”. According to the barrister, consideration of any rights in the Treaty, such as the political offence exception, that are not explicitly incorporated into UK legislation is not at discretion of the SSHD. On the issue of potential changes to the charges Assange faces once he is extradited – something that is usually prohibited in extradition cases - Mr Justice Johnson asked the Secretary of State’s representative if there is any safeguard to prevent this happening. The lawyer confirmed that there were not. Probing further, Mr Justice Johnson asked if the SSHD’s representative accepted that some charges that might be added in the future could lead to the death penalty. The lawyer said he accepted that risk in principle. Mr Justice Johnson then asked clarifications on whether there was a way to prevent death penalty. “It would be very difficult to offer assurances that prevent death penalty from being imposed,” said the lawyer. However, “This does not mean the Secretary of State was wrong” when she authorised extradition. Later, Mark Summers KC, representing Julian Assange, gave his own response on this issue. “We don’t understand why there is no usual death penalty assurances in this case,” he said. The consequence, Summers argued, is that - given the UK’s opposition to the death penalty - discharge of the extradition “must follow” if the US refuses to give such assurances. Joel Smith KC, for the Government of the United States, told the judges that “imposing UK sentencing policy” on the United States is not part of the function of the UK courts. Smith also said that Assange encouraged sources to circumvent legal safeguards on information and build a pattern of “illegally procuring and providing” classified information to Wikileaks for distribution to the public. Responding to the arguments of the US and the SSHD, Edward Fitzgerald KC countered the suggestion that the political offence exception to extradition, enshrined in the UK-US Extradition Treaty but not provided for in the latest domestic Extradition Act, was outmoded, or that Parliament had actively decided to do away with it. “This country continues to sign treaties that provide that bar,” which also forms part of model extradition agreements produced by the UN and Interpol. The US is “seeking extradition on the basis of UK-US extradition Treaty”, which formed the basis of Julian Assange’s detention, so one “can’t escape the treaty. ” Mark Summers KC, for Julian Assange, told the court that the respondents had simply not answered the arguments put to them. It was “impressive” that the respondents had opined on the limits of responsible journalism for two hours without mentioning that the revelations at issue here were state crimes of the highest order. He said it was not surprising that Clair Dobbin could not give a convincing answer on what should happen in a case where secret information had been solicited and published, and where redaction had taken place. The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg’s Article 10 case law required that a balancing of interests take place, even where classified or secret information was concerned. The precedent the US Government relied on was so old it pre-dated the UK Human Rights Act and the treatment of freedom of expression rights had moved on since then. “If you think Strasbourg would consider the Article 10 argument,” he told the court, “then it must be arguable here. ” At around 4. 30, Dame Victoria Sharp told the court that the decision on permission to appeal would be reserved for a future date after 4 March 2024.

    "body": "2024/02/21 - Assange not a journalist or entitled to protection, lawyers for US Government tell court Proceedings resumed this morning with the court hearing legal submissions from the prosecution concerning why WikiLeaks Publisher Julian Assange should be denied permission to appeal his extradition. As with the first day of hearing, Mr Assange was not in court. Clair Dobbin KC for the Crown Prosecution Service, arguing on behalf of the United States, opened by telling the court that Assange could not be considered a journalist and the affidavit submitted by the US addressed every aspect of the defence arguments. “The charges might be unprecedented but what he did was also unprecedented,” she said. After some minutes, Judge Sharp announced a pause of the proceedings because it was necessary to make sure that people in Court 3 could hear them. According to Dobbin, Mr Assange’s actions were different from a journalist’s in that he solicited the bulk disclosure of secret documents, was complicit to Ms. Manning’s theft of classified information and also responsible for ‘indiscriminately and knowingly’ publishing that information. WikiLeaks is ‘an organisation that advertises itself as soliciting illegally obtained material,’ the KC said; adding that the defence arguments related to Article 10, protecting freedom of speech, cannot be considered valid. The second superseding indictment laid against Mr Assange just before the extradition hearing in the District Court put a different complexion on his conduct, showing his communications with hackers and soliciting disclosures from security agencies. The key point, she said, is not just the content of journalistic stories but rather in the methods journalists use to produce them. It’s about the “lawfulness of their conduct,” she said. Responding to another argument out forward by Assange’s legal team yesterday, Ms Dobbin went on to question whether Chelsea Manning could really be considered a whistleblower. “The sheer extent of the indiscriminate nature of the disclosures that Ms Manning made” of national defence material, in contravention of the duties she had as a member of the US military, would surely rule that out, she said. One point that attracted the judges’ attention was the issue of what protections Julian Assange would have in the United States. One of the witness statements the US Government had provided to the District Court questioned whether Assange would be entitled to First Amendment protections should he find himself in an American courtroom. In an interjection a the end of the session, Mr Justice Johnson suggested that this was clearly relevant to the prohibition of discrimination included in the 2003 Extradition Act: “The test is not that he would be prejudiced, it is that he might be prejudiced on the grounds of his nationality”. He then asked if was possible to prove that a foreign national is entitled to the same rights as a US citizen. Dobbin could not identify any evidence that was relevant to this point. The case continues. "

    "title": "Assange Court Report: February 20 - afternoon",
    "body": "2024/02/20 - If extradited, Assange could face death penalty, court hears “The press should be able to publish what it knows,’” Mark Summers KC said at the outset of this afternoon’s court session, arguing that the original judge in the case had made a fundamental mistake by underrating the novelty and danger of the US prosecution of WikiLeaks Publisher Julian Assange. Prosecution of a journalist and publisher under the US Espionage Act, argued Summers, was so unexpected and unusual that it represented a breach of Article 7 of the European Convention of Human Rights, which protects individuals from arbitrary or unpredictable charges. The danger of the Assange prosecution, Summers went on to argue, to Article 10 (freedom of expression) rights is fundamental. He pointed out that the lower court judge had heard evidence from authoritative figures regarding the practice of obtaining and releasing classified information in the United States, nothing terribly unusual in journalistic terms, with no prosecution for such acts. Considering this, the prosecution of the WikiLeaks founder as a publisher “crosses new legal frontiers. ” Summers then analysed the relevance of Article 10 of the European Convention of Human Rights in the case. Importantly, he noted that the case law of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) in Strasbourg – to which this extradition case may be appealed in due course – regarding whistleblowers had evolved a great deal over the past decade and that UK law had not caught up with this. He argued that, if the case of WikiLeaks source Chelsea Manning had come before it today, the Strasbourg court would likely have recognised her as a whistleblower, deserving of legal protections. Publishing leaked national security information would be legal because it is “protected by universally recognised principles of free speech,” he said. Running through some of the criteria the ECtHR has employed in important whistleblowing cases that have come before it in recent years, he argued that Chelsea Manning was ‘conscience driven’, and exposing state criminality is ‘at the highest level of public interest. ’ If Chelsea Manning would be recognised as a whistleblower under current Article 10 case law, it should be clear that publication of those disclosures would also be protected. Judge Dame Victoria Sharp interjected by asking if he had supporting case law court for whistleblower protection instances where the names of government sources had been revealed, given the publication of unredacted cables in this case. Mark Summers KC responded that the ECtHR would likely make a context specific judgement on this and that it had been ‘a glaring legal error’ from the District Judge not to balance the risk of harming people with the public interest in disclosing information about tortures, extrajudicial imprisonments, and war crimes. Edward Fitzgerald KC then rose to present the final part of the appeal arguments, which focused on the ability of Julian Assange to receive a fair trial in the US.  Citing statements supplied to the lower court by Gordon Kromberg, a prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia, where Assange has been indicted, Fitzgerald said “the US government has argued that Julian would have no protection under the First Amendment of the US Constitution. ” Judge Sharp interjected again to refer to the diplomatic assurances given by the US Government to the effect that Assange might eventually be able to be transferred to Australia to serve any sentence. Fitzgerald reminded her that, for that to happen, there is a requirement of “remaining on pre-trial remand”, and Assange would have had to have exhausted all his possible appeals, even if Australia were happy to receive him. Attention then turned to issues that, Mr Assange’s legal team argued, the UK Home Secretary had not taken into account in her decision to allow the extradition to go ahead. These included the potential for additional charges to be laid on Mr Assange once he arrived in the US and the possibility that Mr Assange may be ‘subject to a death penalty’. Mark Summers referred to the fact that Chelsea Manning had been charged – though not convicted on a treason charge (“Aiding the Enemy”) and explained that, consequently, Assange could conceivably be charged with aiding treasonous acts, a charge that would carry the death penalty. As such “extradition which exposes a defendant to the death penalty is prohibited in all circumstances by section 94 of the UK-US extradition treaty. ” Mr Justice Johnson then asked if the death penalty issue could be addressed by the existing diplomatic assurance. Summers KC denied this was the case. The second day of the hearing will focus on the response to these arguments from the Government of the United States and the UK Home Office. The case continues. "

    "body": "2024/02/20 - Espionage Act charges are “quintessentially political,” Assange defence argues Hundreds of protesters showing support to Julian Assange assembled this morning outside London’s Royal Courts of Justice, for what could be the WikiLeaks publisher’s final opportunity to put his arguments against extradition in a UK courtroom. Assange is facing an unprecedented US prosecution under the 1917 Espionage Act centering on WikiLeaks’ publications in 2010-2012. This week’s two-day hearing is taking place to request permission for an appeal against points rejected at Westminster Magistrates Court in January 2021 as well as the extradition order signed in June 2022 by former UK Home Secretary Priti Patel.  These matters, set to one side at a relatively early stage in these extradition proceedings, include some of the most critical issues raised by the US prosecution, including whether the US prosecution is politically motivated and the likely impact on media freedom. Assange was reported to be ill and unable to attend in person or via video link today’s hearing, where his legal team are asking two High Court judges – Dame Victoria Sharp and the Hon Mr Justice Jeremy Johnson KC – to grant a new appeal hearing. Barrister Edward Fitzgerald KC focused on the argument that extradition would be politically motivated and supplied examples of cases related to espionage where extraditions were denied because the charges associated to it were assessed to be Espionage, he told the Court, is “quintessentially a political offence” and extradition on these grounds is prohiited under  Article 4(1) of the UK-US Extradition Treaty of 2003. Granting extradition in these circumstances would be “an abuse of process”, he said. “It’s a big step to say this centuries old protection, incorporated in every UK-US extradition treaty, has been superseded, silently” Fitzgerald highlighted statements made by US politicans and government officals, arguing that these demonstrate Suggesting that the extradition is politically motivated, reminding the court that “Mike Pompeo defined WikiLeaks as a hostile, non-state intelligence agency. ” He suggested the District Judge could not reasonably have concluded that describing Wikileaks in such way had no particular relevance. Mark Summers KC, another member of Assange’s defence team, then made the argument that the WikiLeaks disclosures exposed state-level criminality, itself a political act. There was no question that the publications had revealed crimes of the highest level of importance and that they had, in some respects, produced changes in the situations concerned. Evidence provided to the District Court by figures like Daniel Ellsberg and Noam Chomsky amply showed that Mr Assange had a distinct political philosophy. He went on to explain that this position was one that the Government of the United States was hostile to, refering to documented interference in attempts to secure accountability for torture initiated by other countries, including Poland and Spain, and opposition to investigations by the International Criminal Court in the Hague. This, he argued, helped account for the “substantial malevolence” behind the prosecution, which could only be understood as a form of retaliation. This, said Summers, reached extraordinary lengths, with attacks on Assange dicussed at the highest level of the US Government. “Donald Trump himself requested to be provided with options on how to do it”, he said. The court rose for lunch at 2 PM in the afternoon. The case continues. "

    "body": "2022/01/24 - Assange Case set for Supreme Court Appeal Julian Assange has been given the go ahead to make an application to appeal his extradition to the United States at Britain’s Supreme Court. The Wikileaks founder, who is facing espionage charges related to the organisation’s journalism in 2010-2011 has been incarcerated in London’s high security Belmarsh prison since 2019 while the extradition saga has played out. After hearing five weeks of evidence the original magistrate, Vanassa Baraitser, ruled a year ago that Assange should not be extradited because of the danger that the oppressive conditions he would be held in the US as a national security prisoner. The US government appealed this decision to the High Court, which overturned Baraitser’s decision on the basis of assurances given by the American side in a diplomatic note after the original verdict. These included a commitment to allow Assange to serve any sentence he received in Australia, and a qualified pledge not to place him under the draconian Special Administrative Measures (SAMS) regime, which bars a prisoner from almost all contact with anyone. Supporters of Assange have pointed out that the promise not to put him under SAMs did not prevent the US authorities from doing so if it was felt there was a need for it in the future. It was these assurances and their timing that was at issue in today’s appeal. The UK Supreme Court does not automatically accept cases, they have to “raise a point of law” or be in the public interest. Today the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Burnett of Maldon, ruled that the ability of a requesting state to give assurances about the treatment of a prisoner after the extradition court had given its verdict had never been considered by the Supreme Court. He, therefore, allowed an application to appeal on this point. Decisions about any further appeal will now be taken in the august surroundings of the Supreme Court in Parliament Square. Should the Supreme Court agree to hear an appeal, as is likely, a hearing will follow in the second half of 2022. The case continues.

Reading a summary of the judgment to a packed court in London’s Royal Courts of Justice, Lord Justice Holroyde said that “assurances” given by the US government in a Diplomatic Note dated 5 February 2021, were, in the court’s view, sufficient to overturn the concerns raised by the District Judge, Vanessa Baraitser, about the conditions Assange would face in the US prison system and the effect this might have on his mental health. The assurances were:    Mr Assange will not be made subject to “special administrative measures” or held at the “ADX” facility (a maximum-security prison in Florence, Colorado, USA), either pretrial or after any conviction. (Unless he commits any future act which renders him liable to such conditions of detention)     The USA will consent to an application by Mr Assange, if he is convicted, to be transferred to Australia to serve his sentence.     That whilst Mr Assange is in custody in the USA he will receive appropriate clinical and psychological treatment as recommended by a qualified treating clinician at the prison where he is held.  Holroyde ordered that the case be returned to the District Court with a direction that a DJ send the case to the Secretary of State, Priti Patel, who will make the decision on whether Mr. Assange should be extradited to the USA. Supporters of Mr. Assange outside the court condemned the decision calling it a “dark day for press freedom,” and his legal team are now considering how to appeal the decision. Mr Assange remains in custody in London’s Belmarsh prison. Follow us on Twitter for live updates on the proceedings: @bridges4media "

    "body": "2021/10/28 - Assange lawyers question validity of US assurances US government assurances about the treatment of Julian Assange, if he isextradited, are “conditional, qualified and aspirational,” the HighCourt has been told. Mark Summers QC, who is part of the Wikileaks founder’s defence team,was commenting on a new US Government statement that their intention wasnot to imprison Assange under Special Administrative Measures (SAMs) orbe placed in a high security Supermax prison. He asked the two judges to consider that the assurances had onlyappeared at this appeal hearing, “Why are they allowed to change theircase after two years with a mentally vulnerable defendant in custody?”he asked, adding “if there was no risk of SAMS they could have made afirm commitment not to impose them, which they have not. This might giveus an indication of their intentions,” he said. “There are genuine questions about their trustworthiness,” he said. Summers also drew attention to a number of statements presented to theoriginal hearings in the case, which led to a district judge rejectingthe US extradition request, noting that while being central to thegovernment’s case, Assistant United States Attorney Gordon Krombergdeclined to take to the witness stand and be cross-examined. Summers suggested that Krombeg’s statements do not rule out SAMS orSupermax prisons, but instead argued that “they are ok. “ He quotedKromberg’s statements where he had said prisoners in a Supermax jailwere not in solitary confinement as they could “shout to the prisonersin the cells beside and above them. ” “This assurance takes us nowhere at all,” Summers said. Summers said that the CIA has classified Wikileaks as a “hostilenon-state intelligence entity,” and according to credible media reportswanted “vengence” over the leaks from the CIA to the extent that theyhad considered kidnapping, or even assassinating Assange. Sommers also noted the Spanish extradition case of a Mr Mendoza in whichUS prosecutors had guaranteed that if he was extradited and convicted hewould be sent back to Spain to serve his sentence. He was duly convictedand applied for transfer but this was refused by the Department ofJustice. Summers said that prosecutors could assert what they wished,but any transfer would ultimately not be their decision. Moving onto possible sentences, the barrister told the court, “Everysingle lawyer, including experienced judges, who have looked at thissay these guidelines would lead to a de facto life sentence… which hewould spend in complete isolation. ” Responding on behalf of the US Government, James Lewis QC told the courtthat Mr Mendoza was eventually returned to Spain to serve his sentence,“Every diplomatic assurance was honoured,” he said. The barristersubmitted that defence arguments about Assange spending his life in asupermax prison under SAMs were “entirely speculative. ” adding that theconditions in these met the requirements of Article 3 of the EuropeanConvention Of Human Rights. Lewis then dismissed the defence argument that the assurances had cometoo late.  “We could start the extradition process all over again, withthe assurances,” he said, noting that it was usual only to provide theseafter a court had expressed concerns. “These are decided at the highest level, they are not dished out likesmarties,” he said adding, “They are a responsible step for anextradition partner to make. ” Lewis continued by saying “My learned friends have completely shiftedtheir ground,” reminding the court that the US government had pledged toallow Assange to serve any sentence in Australia so there was noprospect of him spending the rest of his life in a Supermax prison. Lewis then ended his submission. The two judges, The Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett and Lord JusticeHolroyd thanked the parties and retired to consider their decision.

    "body": "2021/10/28 - Overwhelming evidence Julian Assange would be isolated in a US prison, court told Julian Assange would inevitably face “harsh isolation” if extradited to America the High Court has been told. Edward Fitzgerald QC, representing the Wikileaks founder was addressing the hearing of the US government’s appeal against the decision that Assange should not be sent to the USA to face charges of espionage. Fitzgerald said the evidence Assange would be put in isolation if extradited is “overwhelming,” adding, “This is not something that would happen in the dim and distant future, it would happen the moment he landed. ” The defence barrister said that this was a “very exceptional case,” as “for many years it wasn’t even thought possible to prosecute Assange at all,” reminding the court “we’ve even seen prosecutors resigning over it. ” The QC also responded to the US Government’s argument that nobody ever extradited from the UK to the USA had ever ended up taking their own life saying: “This has nothing to do with the Americans, it’s to do with the courts here protecting vulnerable UK citizens, and now they are trying to turn that against us. ” Fitzgerald also addressed the issue of an expert report produced by eminent psychiatrist Michael Kopelman. Yesterday the head of the US Government’s legal team, James Lewis QC, condemned the report as misleading as it had not mentioned that Mr Assange had fathered two children while in the Ecuadorian embassy in London. The QC reminded the court of recent news reports claiming that the CIA considered killing Assange. “There were great grounds for fearing what would be done to him given the revelations of surveillance in the embassy and plots to kill him,” he said. Fitzgerald argued Kopelman did say in his report that Assange had started a relationship with a woman while he was in the embassy, but decided not to name her for safety reasons and he had also taken legal advice over this. Fitzgerald says the original judge heard that evidence first-hand and had ruled not naming Assange’s partner was due to “understandable human concerns. ” He insisted that Kopelman was not acting on Mr. Assange’s instructions but instead on his own initiative. He also attacked the US legal team for what he called, “recklessly, publicly” stating that there was a finding that the court had been misled by the psychiatrist, saying “there was no such finding. ” He also attacked the US side for implying a historic quote by Kopelman (“I like to work inside the system to promote the cause of justice”) as evidence he was dishonest. Fitzgerald called this “Scraping the barrel in an unworthy manner” and “not conducive to the proper consideration of the issues before this court. ” The defence is expected to finish its submissions this afternoon and after a short reply from the US side, the two judges, The Lord Chief Justice, Lord Burnett of Maldon and Lord Justice Holroyd, will retire to consider their decision.

    "body": "2021/10/27 - US says Assange judge made decision on “misleading” evidence A key defence witness in the Julian Assange extradition case produced “actively misleading,” medical evidence, the High Court has been told. Professor Michael Kopelman, professor of neuropsychology at Kings College London was asked by Mr Assange’s legal team to produce a report on the Wikileaks founder’s mental state, and he later gave oral evidence during the four week hearing at the Old Bailey last year. However, counsel for the US government, James Lewis QC, argued at today’s appeal hearing, brought by the US to try and overturn the previous decision that Assange should not be extradited, that “no weight,” should be given to Professor Kopelman’s testimony. The QC told the court that Kopelman’s diagnosis was based on “self-reporting” by Assange and that the WikiLeaks founder was an “avid reader” of the British Medical Journal. ” Lewis also noted that Assange had met his legal team before he met the psychiatrist. “We can’t read anything into that,” the judge responded. Lewis continued by saying Kopelman’s report was “misleading,” as it failed to mention Assange was in a relationship while in the Ecuadorian embassy and had fathered two children, instead of describing his conditions were, “akin to solitary confinement. ” “Saying he had started a family might have put a different complexion on things,” the QC said, The QC notes that Stella Morris is interviewed in Kopelman’s report, but nowhere is it mentioned she is Assange’s partner and mother of two of his children, an omission Lewis said was “actively misleading. ” “This was not an honest declaration of truth,” and the judge was mistaken to rely on it,” he continued, observing that the court itself was only told about the two children during a bail application last year. Mr Lewis then read out long excerpts from his own cross-examination of Kopelman (you can find a full report on that here. ) Lewis then noted that the District Judge had said she “preferred,” Professor Kopelman’s evidence but not given any reason why despite his own cross-examination. “We asked her to give it no weight, and she gave it all the weight, ignoring the other psychiatrists,” the QC said. Rising for the defence Edward Fitzgerald QC argued that that the District Judge’s ruling was correct saying the US side “is asking for reasons about reasons,” and that, “A judge can’t give a reason why they accept or reject every single piece of expert evidence, it’s just not possible. ” He said that the original judge had seen weeks of hearings, and had heard Kopelman in person being cross-examined. She had also told the court that she had not been misled, as she had known about the situation and regarded Kopelamn’s actions as “A natural human response,” to the perceived danger Assange’s partner was seen to be in. “We must respect her conclusions,” Fitzgerald said. . Saying she had heard all of the defence witnesses including those who testified on US prison conditions. He then said the prosecution submissions were “just an attempt to relitigate the case. ” The QC also said many of the issues Assange was faced with were not a product of Special measures of a Supermax prison but were systemic in US jails.  Therefore the qualified assurances he would not face a Supermax regime were worthless. Court then adjourned for the day, with the defence set to continue its submissions tomorrow.

    "body": "2021/10/27 - US presents assurances on Assange detention, as appeal hearing opens If convicted by the United States of espionage Julian Assange would be repatriated to Australia to serve any sentence, the High Court has been told. The statement came during the first day of a two-day hearing that will decide whether to quash or uphold, a lower court decision in January this year that to extradite the Wikileaks founder would, given US prison conditions, lead to a severe risk Assange would take his own life. James Lewis QC, who is representing the US Government in the case told the presiding judges, including the Lord Chief Justice, that “diplomatic assurances,” given by the US about confinement on Assange were binding, adding “Your lordships will know that a very strong part of extradition law is that assurances are given and that they are trusted. ” The QC continued: “He’ll have a cellmate, you can’t call it solitary confinement if he has a cellmate. ” and noted that the accused could apply for a “speedy trial,” in the US if he is extradited which means his case would be heard within 70 days. However, Lewis did admit that it is still possible Assange could face “Special Administrative Measures,” saying “We cannot give him a blank check to do whatever he likes. ” Special Administrative Measures (“SAMS”) include a number of restrictions. The person concerned is not allowed to communicate with other prisoners or staff and their ability to stay in touch with family and friends is severely limited. As one witness told the District Court in September 2020, “Most Special Administration Measures inmates spend all day, almost every day, completely alone…They live in abysmal conditions, with no end in sight” The QC also told the court he disagreed with the defence on the length of sentence Assange might face telling the court the usual punishment was “A small number of years. ” He also told the court that the US prison system has a lower rate of suicide per inmate than the prison estate of England and Wales. Mr Assange himself had asked to be excused from attending the hearing by video link from Belmarsh prison, where he has been held since 2019, as he was “taking some new medication. ” he did however appear on the screen for around an hour observing proceedings before leaving with a guard. The hearing is set for two days, with a written decision expected to follow. Follow us on Twitter for live updates on the proceedings: @bridges4media "

    "body": "2021/08/11 - US Government will be allowed to challenge Assange medical evidence London’s High Court has reversed a decision not to allow the US government to appeal the psychiatric evidence in the Julian Assange extradition case. In January, after five weeks of evidence, District Judge Vanessa Baraitser ruled that to extradite Assange to the USA on espionage charges would be “oppressive,” due to the Wikileaks founder’s mental health. Judge Baraitser found there was an unacceptably high risk Assange would commit suicide if imprisoned under the draconian conditions he would experience in a US Supermax prison. The US Gvernment appealed the January decision to the High Court, which initially decided to hear the case, but not allow Baraitser’ ruling on Assange’s mental health to be challenged. At today’s hearing, the US successfully reversed that decision. Counsel for the US, Clare Dobbin QC, argued that Professor Michael Kopelman, the psychiatrist who gave evidence for the defence, had not included important details in his initial report to the court. He had not mentioned Assange was in a long term relationship and had fathered two children while in the Ecuadorian embassy, despite being aware of this. Dobbin said this non-disclosure of Assange’s family status shows Kopelman was “willing to mislead” and had “ignored his duty to the court” as an expert witness. Kopelman, an emeritus professor of psychiatry at King’s College London had, Dobbin said, “subjugated his duty to the court to the interests of Assange’s family” and demanded that the US side should be able to raise this point on appeal. Responding for the defence Edward Fitzgerald QC argued that the original judge had asked the right questions at the time. In her ruling, she had decided that Kopelman could be criticised for not mentioning Assange’s relationship but, nevertheless, his report was still impartial and unbiased Mr Fitzgerald added that at that time there were serious threats to Assange, including a security company which had discussed kidnapping or posioning him. There were fears his partner and children might have been put in danger if their identities were revealed. He also noted that Assange himself had revealed the relationship to the psychiatrist from the prosecution when interviewed. In his ruling this afternoon, presiding judge Lord Justice Holroyde, said he believed it was arguable that the court had attached too much weight to the evidence of Prof Michael Kopelman. He said he would allow the US to raise the issue in the full hearing, which is expected to be heard on 27 and 28 October. Mr Assange remains in custody at London’s Belmarsh prison.

    "body": "2021/01/06 - Judge denies Assange bail Despite Monday’s judgment dismissing the US government’s request for extradition, Julian Assange will remain in prison, a court has ruled. District Judge Vannesa Baraitser, who made Monday’s ruling, today refused to release the Wikileaks founder on bail ahead of a possible American appeal, despite arguments made by the defence that he would have no reason to abscond from the country and would agree to wear a tracing tag and conditions described as “virtual house arrest. ” During the hearing in an almost empty, socially distanced Westminster Magistrates Court, counsel for the US government, Clair Dobbin, objected to bail on the basis that the US government side was preparing to appeal the decision, although, notably, did not say they definitely would. Under UK extradition regulations the losing side in a case has 15 days from the original judgment to file appeal papers at London’s High Court. Dobbin submitted to the court that Assange had, in 2012 while on bail over a Swedish charge, gone to the Ecuadorian embassy in London to avoid being extradited there, saying “he went to extraordinary lengths. ” She said any US appeal “would be rendered academic” if Assange was not remanded in custody and that his assistance to NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden getting to Moscow to seek asylum showed Assange had the resources and support network to fly, for example, to Mexico, whose president had already publically offered him political asylum. Responding for the defence, Edward Fitzgerald QC noted that Assange had already spent 15 months in prison due to the American extradition request and told Judge Bariatser “your judgement [on Monday] had changed everything. He also noted that an appeal was not certain, quoting an interview with US prosecutor Zachary Terwilliger, who had been supervising the case, who had said: “It will be very interesting to see what happens with this case, there will be some decisions to be made, some of this does come down to resources and where you focus your energies. ” The QC also noted that the incoming Biden administration may well take a different attitude to the current Trump one. Fitzgerald also submitted that the judgment not to allow extradition gave Assange a huge motive to stay in the UK, saying the Mexican president’s remarks had been misquoted and asking, “How on Earth is he [Assange] going to get to Mexico?” He concluded by saying that Assange knew “he is safest and best in this country with the protection of the rule of law and the cloak of this court’s judgment. ” Dismissing the application Baraitser said, “This case is not yet won” as Assange had broken bail conditions in the past and retained resources and a support network that could facilitate the WikiLeaks founder’s flight. Mr Assange was then taken from the dock to the cells under the court for transport back to a cell in Belmarsh prison. The US government now has 13 days to formally submit its appeal to the High Court. Follow us on Twitter for live updates on the proceedings: @bridges4media "

    "body": "2021/01/04 - Judge denies Assange extradition In a dramatic day at London’s Old Bailey, District judge Vanessa Baraitser blocked a US government bid to extradite WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange on charges of espionage. In a statement of about one hour, delivered to a packed Court 2, Baraitser rejected the bulk of the defence submissions against extradition, such as freedom of speech, the European Convention of Human Rights and the wording of the treaty between the USA and the UK, before agreeing that, given Mr Assange’s psychological state and the evidence that he would face being “held in a cage” in isolation, extradition would inevitably lead to a deterioration in his mental state and an increased risk of suicide or self-harm. She concluded by saying: “The overall impression is of a depressed and sometimes despairing man who is genuinely fearful about his future. . it would be oppressive to extradite him to the United States of America. ” While a large crowd of the Wikileaks supporters outside the court cheered and celebrated, counsel for the United States government was given 15 days to decide whether to appeal the decision to the High Court. A further hearing will be held this Wednesday, January 6, to decide if Mr Assange should be granted bail in the interim. Until then he remains in custody in London’s Belmarsh Prison. Assange’s partner Stella Morris, speaking outside court, said the ruling was “the first step towards justice,” but added that it was still not yet time to finally celebrate. The case continues.

    "body": "2020/10/01 - Assange extradition decision to be announced on 4 January, 2021 The judgment in the extradition hearing of Julian Assange will be announced on the 4 January 2021. The final day of the hearing of Julian Assange was delayed until 3pm today as the defence and prosecution went through a process of trying to come to an agreement on the content of a number of witness statements. At the beginning of the hearing the presiding judge, Vannesa Baraitser, decided that evidence would be heard via written statements, with people only being called in person only if the prosecution or the defence wished to cross-examine a witness on their written evidence. The trial has already over-run its scheduled three-week span by four days partly due to a member of one of the legal teams having to be tested for Covid-19. In his statement, a summary of which was read out by defence counsel Mark Summers QC, criminal defence attorney and Professor Emeritus at Duke Law School Michael Tigar said that Watergate showed how access to sources and confidential information can “change history,” and described WikiLeaks as “the intelligence agency of the people. ” On the subject of whistleblowers, he remarked, “We owe these people a great deal. ” Tigar also noted that under the US Espionage Act, which is the source of most of the charges against Assange, the accused cannot challenge the designation of documents as confidential, or introduce evidence about their motives in court. The next statements heard by the court were from defence solicitor Gareth Pierce, which clarified evidence the court heard yesterday about the Spanish security company, UC Global and their alleged spying on Julian Assange while he was in the Ecuadorian Embassy. In another statement, she said that “legally privileged documents” had gone missing after Assange was arrested at the Embassy in April 2019. She also provided a statement about the difficulties Assange had faced in gathering evidence to defend himself from extradition, including problems locating witnesses and the fact that the US government issued a “superseding indictment,” in July changing some of the charges against him. She also noted that the information that her client’s conversations with his legal teams at the Embassy were recorded continued to have a “chilling effect” and damaged the confidence of Assange’s lawyers that their current discussions with their client are not still being monitored by US intelligence. The defence also noted there were still live legal proceeding in Spain over the allegations of the Embassy spying. The defence then asked the judge for permission to introduce three further statements into evidence, a move the prosecution opposes as they say these have been introduced “at the 59th minute,” which meant they had not had a chance to put them to witnesses. One of these, the court heard, was a full transcript of a speech Julian Assange made at London’s Frontline Club, a video clip of which was shown by the prosecution in the first week of evidence. Another contained remarks made by US Attorney General William Barr, which he had made while this hearing was ongoing so could not have been submitted earlier, the defence said. Judge Baraitser said she had already expressed concerns about the defence submitting evidence late, and it “was not in the interests of justice” for it to be admitted. She, therefore, rejected the defence application. The judge has already ruled that closing arguments from both sides, which are usually heard orally in court will, in this case, be presented in writing at a later date. The court then adjourned.

    "body": "2020/09/30 - Assange spying ordered by senior Trump associate A Spanish security firm secretly filmed and recorded Julian Assange on the orders of Donald Trump associate Sheldon Adelson, the Wikileaks founder’s London extradition hearing has been told. Contractors hired by Adelson also discussed kidnapping or poisoning the Wikileaks founder and allegedly broke into the office of his lawyer, as well as passing on the information to US intelligence agencies. The evidence, read out in court, came from two former employees of a security company UC Global, who have been granted anonymity amid fears for their safety. Witness 1 stated that they worked for UC Global, whose owner, David Morales, had a contract with the Ecuadorian government which included providing security at their embassy in London where Assange was residing. In July 2016, Morales travelled to a trade fair at Las Vegas, saying he wanted to go alone. After this the company got a “flashy contract,” from Trump associate Sheldon Adelson. “The contract did not make sense,” Witness 1 said, as it was for security services at Adelson’s casinos which already had their own security. Asked how he got the contract, Morales allegedly told the witness, “We have gone over to the dark side,” saying they were co-operating with the US intelligence authorities to gather information on Assange. The witness continued that after Trump won the 2016 election, this co-operation “became absolutely clear,” and daily reports were “sent to the dark side. ” Morales went to the US once a month personally “to talk to our American friends, US intelligence,” and his wealth considerably increased. The witness stated their understanding was that Morales was receiving $200,000 per month for his services. Witness 1 stated that in 2016, the CCTV cameras in the Embassy were changed to record sound, with the tapes given to the US authorities. Morales, the witness stated, was “obsessed” with Assange’s meetings with his lawyers because that was the information “the American friends wanted. ” The court then heard the written evidence from Witness 2, who stated that they were an IT worker. They said that Morales had asked for cameras that recorded sound in a way that could not be detected to be installed at the embassy. Morales also wanted US intelligence to have real-time access to the embassy, orders that came from the “highest spheres. ” The company also installed a microphone in the toilets of the embassy that was hidden in an electrical socket. The entire embassy was bugged, they stated, adding that Morales wanted to record meetings with Assange’s legal team, as the lawyers were the “priority targets. ” Contractors obtained Assange’s fingerprints from a water glass, and the witness was asked to obtain a baby’s nappy so that US intelligence could check if the child was Assange’s The witness also stated that they had heard staff discussing entering the office of one of the lawyers. Two weeks later media reported men in balaclavas had indeed broken in. They also heard discussion of more extreme measures, such as leaving the embassy door open so Assange could be kidnapped and discussion of poisoning him. The court was told that Spanish authorities have since arrested Morales and proceedings are ongoing. The two witnesses are under armed protection after police found a gun with the serial number filed off in Morales’ home Yesterday, before the statements were read, counsel for the US government James Lewis QC, said that he “had received no instructions,” over these statements from his clients, so would not require the witnesses to appear by video link to be cross-examined. He added that there was a “Chinese wall,” between the Justice Department and US intelligence, so any information that may or may not have been gathered would be not be known to prosecutors.

    "body": "2020/09/29 - “They live in abysmal conditions, with no end in sight” “Most Special Administration Measures inmates spend all day, almost every day, completely alone,” the Old Bailey extradition trial of Julian Assange has been told. The testimony came from Lindsay Lewis, a US attorney who represents UK Islamic preacher Abu Hamza, convicted of terrorism charges, who is imprisoned in a Colorado “Supermax” prison. She told the court her client has been under these “Special Administrative Measures” (SAMs) for 8 years. The witness said that during Hamza’s extradition trial from the UK, representations were given by the US Government in court in the UK that Hamza would not be detained in the Colorado ADX Supermax prison, yet he has been imprisoned there ever since his conviction 5 years ago. She added that Hamza has suffered serious psychological consequences from enforced isolation, but was limited in what she could say about his situation and could only comment on documents that had been made public because even lawyers are restricted in what they can say under the SAMs rules. Lewis said that Assange would “almost certainly” be placed on SAMs if extradited to the United States, “due to the national security nature of the case and the claim of harm done,” adding that “most SAM inmates spend all day, almost every day, completely alone and for years at a time. ” She said that under these measures phone calls were limited to one a month, and could only be made to approved relatives; in-person family visits were almost impossible and communal prayer is also not permitted. The attorney told the court that 82% of inmates on SAMs are on them for more than a year, 18% for more than a decade, and it was a “long, drawn-out process to appeal. I don’t know any inmate that has succeeded. ” One prisoner she knew of had been on SAMS for 20 years and she did not know of any post-conviction case where a court has ruled against an inmate being held on SAMs “They live in abysmal conditions, with no end in sight,” Lewis said. Cross-examining for the US government, barrister Clare Dobbin argued that there was no commitment Hamza would be not put in a Supermax prison, only that his state of health would be considered before a decision was made (Hamza had diabetes and lost both forearms in an explosion). Lewis replied, “They misled the courts, I can’t see any other interpretation,” saying if there was a medical assessment it must have taken the form of a “rubber stamp. ” She said that the prison could not deal with double amputees stating, “The only conclusion that can be taken from this is that the US did a 180 and completely backed out of their undertakings. ” Dobbin then suggested that Lewis’ opinion was only based on what Hamza had told her. The witness said that she had interviewed members of staff from the ADX and other sources. “Much of it has been independently verified,” she added. When Dobbin suggested that Hamza was only complaining about small things, Lewis replied that he is complaining about dental care and that Dobbin was “trivialising things,” adding, “He has to open cans with his teeth,” as he was not allowed any openers in his cell. The US government barrister then raised the issue of the Cunningham decision, a case brought by an ADX prisoner prosecution which led to a legal judgment that led to improvements being made in mental health treatment in the institution. After being told that over 100 people had been transferred out of ADX for mental health reasons, Lewis replied, “I’m interested in the people still in there,” and noted that care in ADX can’t be that good if the only way to deal with inmates with mental health issues “was to ship them out somewhere else. ” Asked if her client had violated SAMs, Lewis replied that, in a letter to his son, Hamza wrote “tell [my grandson] I love him. ” His SAMs was then renewed for another year for “unauthorised communication with a 3rd party, a 1-year-old child. ” The trial continues.

    "body": "2020/09/29 - Assange would have to be “nearly dead” to avoid Supermax prison A 27-year veteran of the US Bureau of Prisons and former warden of a New York Metropolitan Correctional Centre has told the Julian Assange extradition hearing that a prisoner convicted of espionage “would have to be nearly dead,” to avoid being sent to the high-security ADX Colorado prison. The witness also said that, in her opinion, the WikiLeaks founder would also be subjected to “Special Administrative Measures,” (SAMs) which, in her experience, meant that inmates were kept in their cells for 23 hours a day, were allowed no contact with other prisoners, and their one exercise only allowed them to leave their cell and go into another cell. Phone calls per month were limited to one for half an hour or two of 15 minutes, and these were monitored by an FBI agent. All incoming mail was screened, which sometimes meant it could take a couple of months for the inmate to receive it. “SAMS is not discretionary, it’s a directive,” Baird said, “there is no black and white and can’t be changed by a warden,” stating that it had become much more utilised after the attacks on 9/11. Asked to comment on prosecution evidence that an inmate could challenge SAM status with their case manager, “it is way over their pay scale, it is unheard of, I’ve never seen anyone with SAMS having it removed. ” Asked why she was so sure that Assange would be treated as a national security risk, Baird said, “because he may still know things that he hasn’t revealed. ” The former warden, who managed a SAM unit for prisoners on remand, told the court, “It’s not meant to be punitive, but the consequences feel punitive, a staff member might walk past their cells but they don’t make contact with them. ” This, she said, caused depression, anxiety and paranoia and sent some people into a “severe psychotic state. ” Even though Assange is not convicted of terrorism, “he will be treated in exactly the same way as someone who is. ” Asked to comment on a quote from its former warden that “ADX Supermax is not built for humanity,” the witness said, “Inmates on SAMS do not participate in any group programmes, any activities would take place alone, no communication with any other inmates and no touching during a family visit. ” “Everything changed after 9/11,” she said. Barrister Claire Dobbin, representing the US government, then rose to cross-examine Baird. She began by questioning her objectivity, saying that as a consultant she only acts for defendants. She also suggested that no one was put on SAMs for espionage as it was only used for terrorists and major drug traffickers, and the witness had no expertise on what the criteria that were used to decide. The witness replied that in the prosecution documents SAMs were mentioned often and it was unusual that it had not been ruled out. “It’s on the table,” she added. Dobbin then said that, in New York, Baird was in a position as warden to make sure her staff communicated with SAMs prisoners. Baird replied that guards did not “stand there and engage, it’s not something a corrections officer does,” adding she did not have the authority to tell staff how to interact with inmates. “They are all in a union, they would say it wasn’t in their job description,” she said, adding, “I’m sorry I’m not answering the questions in the way you want me to. ” Responding to a suggestion that she, as the warden, did nothing to try and improve conditions for inmates in her prison on SAMs, she replied that these things were decided, “way above my level. ” Asked why she was sure that all convicted prisoners under SAMs go to the ADX, she responded, “There’s nowhere else for them to go, other places don’t have the facilities to enforce the conditions of isolating long-term,” saying that the only exceptions she knew of were “people with stage 4 cancer or something, who are nearly dead. ” Asked about testimony from a US doctor that prisoners on SAMs could engage in group therapy sessions at the ADX, Baird replied: “that would defeat the purpose of it, the whole point is to stop the inmate communicating with other prisoners. ” The trial continues.

He continued, “in my opinion, the words of the Chief Judge of the US District Court in the Southern District of New York summed it up best: ‘I take it as a matter of settled fact that the Bureau of Prisons is not the best place for anyone to receive medical care. ’” On the issue of the potential sentence faced by Assange, Sickler said, “He has released details of some of the vilest crimes in US history… he could seriously get life, especially in this district. ” Asked by the prosecution about a government report that said conditions in the ADX prison in Virginia are so good prisoners state they will commit an assault rather than be transferred, he replied “If it’s such a wonderful place I don’t know why so many people are trying to get out of it, but if it’s true, great. ” He added that he has a client there “and he has written to the judge begging to get out. ” The trial continues.

    "body": "2020/09/28 - Assange facing “X-block” in US prison, court told If extradited, Julian Assange will face effective solitary confinement with no contact with other prisoners in a special “X-block” wing, his extradition trial in London has been told. The testimony came from Washington-based defence attorney Yancey Ellis who is familiar with the Alexandria jail where Assange would be held on remand as he has often visited clients held there. The witness told the court, “The point of the unit is to keep the prisoner away from other inmates, and is officially known as administrative segregation, “Ad-Seg,” and is effectively solitary confinement. The staff and prisoners, however, refer to it as “X-Block. ”” Ellis described conditions saying each cell has a shelf with a mat and blanket on it, a small toilet “and not much else. ” Prisoners are only allowed out for 1-2 hours per day and often and odd times so they do not mix with other inmates. Ellis said prisoners on X-block are usually not allowed to associate with other prisoners, the doors are too thick to be heard through “without almost screaming,” and when an inmate does exercise they do so alone. “Anyone who says prisoners can communicate with each other hasn’t been there,” Ellis added, saying that when he had to consult clients he had to communicate through the secure slot that was used to put food through. Asked about medical care, Ellis said it was “very limited,” as the jail did not employ a doctor, instead they used an outside agency that sent in a psychiatrist “occasionally. ” There was also a “special suit” that is placed on inmates who might be in danger of self-harm. He also noted that there was not usually a member of staff in the unit, “as the inmates are all locked down. ” Cross-examining for the US government, James Lewis QC suggested that Assange’s well known public status would mean the prison was unlikely to place him in solitary confinement. “He will have a phalanx of lawyers to protect him,” he suggested. Ellis responded, “I don’t know what difference that will make, the Alexandria jail doesn’t give anyone special treatment. ” The court then heard from another US witness, Joel Sickler, a lawyer who specialises in post-conviction work and prison conditions. Asked if prisoners in the X-block could communicate with each other from their different cells he said no, firstly because the doors were made of thick metal and secondly because the prison itself was a very noisy environment with lots of “screaming and yelling. ” In the X-block, “your whole world is the corners of that room. ” he said. The lawyer also testified about the conditions Mr Assange would face if convicted and placed in a Federal “Supermax,” prison under likely conditions of Special Administrative Measures (SAM) routinely imposed on inmates seen as a threat to national security. He described conditions of solitary confinement, a 15-minute telephone call with relatives only once a month, and no real chance of appealing your status. “It’s a feudal system,” Sickler said regarding US Supermax prisons, saying he had one client who had been in solitary confinement for 23 years, since he was 19 years old. Asked if there was an upper limit to the time you can spend on SAM, He replied that it was usually indefinite adding, There was a “step-down program,” however, if Assange was given a life sentence, “it’s pointless” to apply. Asked about mental health care in prison, Sickler said the US government claims only 3% of Federal prisoners have mental health issues, a figure he says that just “does not ring true,” as state prisons report a rate of 25%. “Why are Federal prisoners so healthy?” he asked.

    "body": "2020/09/25 - “Millions” had access to documents before WikiLeaks released them, court hears After the lunch interval, defence witness Patrick Eller, being re-examined by the defence said he did not know the identity of “Nathaniel Frank” who is one of the names in the chat logs with Chelsea Manning presented by the US government in evidence. The prosecution allege that Julian Assange agreed to help Chelsea Manning increase her access to a US government computer network. Asked how many people had access to the computer system in question,” the witness replied, “probably millions. ” The defence suggested cracking the hash value was “computationally infeasible” and the witness agreed even a skilled hacker could not do it. The prosecution then rose to object saying they only allege the cracking was “tried,” not that it was successful. Judge Baraitser responded that this was a “fair point. ” The computer expert then ended his evidence. The court then moved on to submissions on the request by a media organisation for a copy of the medical reports that have been presented in evidence this week. Both the defence and prosecution opposed this on the basis that breached Mr Assange’s privacy and key points in the reports have been aired in court over three days of oral evidence. One of the court reporters spoke and told the judge that they have no desire to add to any pain being suffered by the families and are guided by rules about not disclosing sensitive material. She added that both sides say that the law is that the press must give a reason to get access to documents, the problem was how would it be possible to give a reason for access to documents if you don’t know what’s in them?

    "body": "2020/09/25 - No Assange ruling before 2021, court told. After granting the defence four additional weeks to submit written submissions the Judge at the Old Bailey extradition trial of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, Vanessa Baraitser said that this would mean it was unlikely that she would now be able to make a ruling before New Year. The judge remarked that she would have to take into account that Mr Assange is in custody when deciding how long she will give the parties to prepare closing speeches. Edward Fitzgerald QC responded, “If you granted him bail that would solve that problem. ” Fitzgerald also observed that there was going to be a US election on 3 November and for Assange, “Things will be worse if Mr Trump is still there - we cannot avoid that political fact. ” There was a heated exchange when the defence requested to introduce new witness evidence in response to testimony from a prosecution witness. Counsel for the US government James Lewis QC said to the judge that the case “needs a firm hand, enough is enough,” adding, “This simply cannot go on or this case will simply never end. ” Responding, defence counsel said, “The prosecution has no divine right to have the last word. ” Judge Baraitser then rejected the defence request. The court heard a written statement from Jakob Augstein, a journalist and publisher of German weekly newspaper Der Freitag. In his statement, Augstein confirmed that Der Freitag had published an article in August 2010 revealing the existence of an obscure website where unredacted US government cables were available to those who had the key. He continued by stating that Assange called him shortly afterwards and requested that he not publish anything that could reveal where the file was located. Julian Assange was concerned about US government informants having their identity revealed and potentially put in danger. The next witness was Patrick Eller, a forensic computer analyst who appeared by video link from the United States. The witness told the court that he had studied the court-martial records of former US soldier Chelsea Manning, who the prosecution say hacked into government computers with the assistance of Assange, as well as interviews with members of her former military unit. Eller said he had concluded that soldiers regularly put unauthorised files and programmes, such as music and games, on secure computers and this required cracking an administration password. Manning, he said, was the “go-to person,” in her unit to do this for her colleagues. Eller testified that in his opinion the encrypted hash value Manning gave to Assange was for this purpose. It could not be used, and would not be needed, for Chelsea Manning to acquire secret documents anonymously. Cross-examining the witness, James Lewis QC suggesed that Assange and Manning “thought they could crack the password and tried to crack the password. ” Eller pointed out the government’s own expert witness in Manning’s court martial had cast doubt on this. Lewis then noted that Assange had said publicly he was an “expert hacker,” and asked the witness if an expert hacker could sometimes break into the most secure systems. Eller agreed.

    "body": "2020/09/24 - Assange suffering from “acute psychological trauma”, doctor says. The London extradition trial of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange entered its 12th day of evidence today to hear a prominent US doctor say that Assange had suffered “acute psychological trauma,” comparable to refugees fleeing war zones. Via video link from the US, Dr Sondra Crosby, Professor of Medicine at Boston University who specialises in internal medicine, told the court that she was one of a group of three doctors who assessed Julian Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in January 2018 and had later visited him twice in Belmarsh prison, when, she said, she had become “alarmed,” at his condition. Responding to prosecution questions that some of her evidence had not appeared on prison records, Ms Crosby said that it was common among prisoners not to reveal their full psychological problems to the prison authorities as they do not wish to be put into isolation.  “It’s a trust issue,” she added. The doctor then compared Mr Assange’s situation to that of victims of post-traumatic stress disorder, normally only experienced by those who had been in war situations, telling the court that, “he is in the same psychological state as someone who was being chased by a man with a knife and then locks themselves in a room and won’t come out,” saying she was “alarmed by his situation. ” In a series of sharp exchanges, counsel on behalf of the US government, James Lewis QC challenged the witness’s objectivity, asking her if she was, “sympathetic to Mr Assange’s cause,” and asking who paid for her trips to London. She replied, “No,” and “I paid for it. ” The prosecution counsel then asked if Crosby, who is based in Boston, was asked if she was “qualified under Section 12 of the UK Mental Health Act. ” Defence counsel Edward Fitzgerald QC then rose to object stating, “No foreigner could ever be, it’s a ridiculous question. ” The prosecution then ended their cross-examination. The court was then read two statements from the defence, the first from an organisation called the Internet Archive confirming that the US government had made no effort to “take down” the Wikileaks archive from the internet. The second statement, read to the packed Old Bailey courtroom, was from John Young, the owner of a US-based website called “Cryptome,” which said that he has had the full Wikileaks unredacted US diplomatic cables on his website and has never been asked to remove them by any US legal authority.

    "body": "2020/09/23 - Prosecution witness admits Assange’s health could decline in US prison Day 11 of evidence the court hearing that will decide if WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange will be extradited to the USA on charges of espionage heard from the first witness to be called by the prosecution, Seena Fazel. In examination in chief, the witness told the court he was professor of forensic psychiatry at the University of Oxford, who focussed on “the relationship between mental illness and violent crime, the mental health of prisoners, and violence risk assessment. ” He confirmed he had been asked by lawyers representing the US government in the case to prepare a report on the mental health of Julian Assange and had visited him in Belmarsh prison to carry out a psychiatric assessment. The report was then entered into evidence. Cross-examined by defence barrister Edward Fitzgerald QC, Fazel agreed that he did not see Mr Assange in the period when other experts have stated his mental health was worse, but only after he came out of isolation and could mix with other prisoners. “It can go up and down?” counsel asked. Fazel agreed that an underlying mental health disorder can improve or get worse over time. Fitzgerald then moved on to “Special Administrative Measures (used in US prisons for prisoners they see as high risk or a threat to national security). If this occurred, Assange would be isolated from other prisoners, be in his cell for 22 hours a day, have limited contact with the outside work and have all his telephone calls monitored by the authorities, including those with his legal representatives. Asked if this could make Assange’s mental health worse, the professor replied “Yes,” but added he would need to know more about the specific situations to be sure. Fitzgerald asked, “He’s alone, he has limited contact with the outside world, his telephone calls are monitored, he has bleak prospects do you would agree there would be a heightened risk?” Fazel replied that mental health is “multi-factoral,” and it would also depend on what treatments were available. Fitzgerald noted that if Assange was seen as a security risk he would not have access to any therapeutic programmes in a US prison. Fitzgerald then asked if the witness was aware of ADX Florence, a “SuperMax,” prison of the type Assange would almost certainly be held in, if convicted in America, which had been described by its former warden as “worse than hell,” and “unfit for human habitation. ” Fazel said he was not an expert on US prison policy and was “only superficially familiar with the literature. ” Prosecution QC, James Lewis, then rose and said that before trial Assange would be held on remand in a Virginia prison, Alexandria Detention Center which, he said, “did not have solitary confinement. ” Lewis then read from an affidavit an Assistant United States Attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, presented to the court by the US government, which described the facilities in ADX Florence, a high security “SuperMax” prison in Colorado, stating that every inmate had access to a small television showing educational and informative programmes selected by the staff. He also described other benefits of the SuperMax jail, including access to videogames and crochet. Court then heard that the American high-security jail also had educational courses prisoners can take such as “7 habits of highly effective people, channelling the artistic spirit, the 5 languages of love, and how to draw. ” There were also weekend “brain teaser” games, arts and crafts, a weekly movie program, and special holiday activities. Court then adjourned. The trial continues. Follow us on Twitter for live updates on the proceedings: @bridges4media "

    "body": "2020/09/23 - Asperger Syndrome puts Assange at “high risk,” if extradited Julian Assange has Asperger Syndrome and would not be able to manage American prison conditions, an Old Bailey court has been told. The testimony, from expert witness Quinton Deeley, a Senior Lecturer in Social Behaviour at King’s College London and Consultant Neuropsychiatrist in the National Autism Unit, came on the 11th day of evidence at the hearing which will determine if the Wikileaks founder should be extradited to the USA on charges of espionage and computer hacking. Asperger Syndrome, Deeley told the court, is a disorder characterized by significant difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication, along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behaviour and interests. The witness said that he had come to this diagnosis after a six-hour telephone interview with Assange, as well as interviews with his friends and family. Asked if the defendant would be able to tolerate conditions in a US prison, which would almost certainly involve solitary confinement, Deeley said “no”, adding that this, given his mental state, would be “unbearable. ” Cross-examining on behalf of the US government, barrister James Lewis QC challenged the psychiatrist’s diagnosis noting that Assange had once hosted a TV chat show, and showed the court a video of Assange eloquently answering questions at a panel discussion at the Frontline Club in London. Deeley responded by saying these were “highly structured environments,” and someone responding well in them did not contradict his medical conclusions. “If he is being treated as an expert and can expand at length, he can deal with that,” the psychiatrist said. Lewis then put to the witness a statement from Assange’s mother that he was a “selfless and dutiful father,” and suggested this was incompatible with a diagnosis of Asperger Syndrome. Deeley replied that people with Asperger’s can still be “dutiful and principled, and moved by the suffering of other people. ” He added that if Assange was extradited he would be at “high risk, more likely than not,” and “any responsible clinician would have to actively manage the serious risks to his health. ” The trial continues.

    "body": "2020/09/22 - US detention would be “very damaging” to Assange, mental health expert says. The tenth day of evidence at the hearing in London that will determine if WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange should be extradited to face espionage charges in America heard further evidence from Professor Michael Kopelman, head of Neuropsychiatry at King’s College London, who has written two reports on Assange’s state of mental health for the court. Cross-examining the witness on behalf of the US government, barrister James Lewis QC suggested to Kopelman that much of his evidence was merely based on what Assange had told him, which he characterised as “self-reporting. ” The professor replied, “That’s the nature of psychiatry; it relies on self-reporting…there’s no scan we can use. ” The prosecution counsel also proposed that the court had seen Mr Assange for two weeks and he was clearly was having no issues in following proceedings. He quoted some of Assange’s interventions from the glass-fronted dock at the back of the court claiming they showed a “very close and accurate response to the proceedings. ” In a sharp exchange, Lewis suggested to Kopelman that a test he cited in support of his conclusion that Assange was not “malingering” (a term for someone who fakes illness for advantage) the “TOMM” test, did not in fact test for what Kopelman claimed. Kopelman replied “I’m an expert on cognitive testing and neuropsychology,” and noted that the full name of the test was the “Test of Memory Malingering. ” Lewis said, “Any mental health issues Mr Assange may have did not stop him stealing secrets from the top level of the US government. ” Kopelman replied he was in no position to comment on that. The witness was then shown various reports from medical staff at Belmarsh prison, where Assange is currently detained, giving a positive view of his mental health. The professor responded by saying that it had taken Assange time to get to trust a new psychologist at Belmarsh prison, “so he did conceal things from her. ” He added that when it came to prison nursing staff Assange said different things to different members of staff, stating “It depended on whom he trusted. ” He also told the court that Mr Assange often hid his true condition from prison staff as he feared being put on constant watch or in isolation from fellow inmates. Kopelman concluded his evidence by telling the court that his understanding is that if Assange were extradited to a US prison he would be placed on “Special Administrative Measures,” a harsh regime where prisoners are shackled and kept in solitary confinement, saying that if Assange were held under those conditions it would be very dangerous given his current mental state.

    "body": "2020/09/22 - Assange Has “A Bundle Of High-Risk Factors,” Expert Tells Court The Julian Assange extradition hearing in London moved on to a new stage on the tenth day of evidence as it began hearing what is expected to be three days of detailed medical evidence from both sides. The first of these witnesses to give evidence was the Section Head of Neuropsychiatry at King’s College London, Professor Michael Kopelman, who appeared for the defence. Kopelman told the court he had visited Assange in prison on a number of occasions, had taken a full medical history and spoken to friends and family before he produced the detailed report that was presented to the court. The witness then gave the court a summary of Mr Assange’s psychiatric history and current symptoms, which, he said, showed that an order of extradition would hugely increase the risk to his mental and physical health, and would lead to “a bundle of high-risk factors. ” Cross-examining on behalf of the US government, prosecution barrister James Lewis questioned the witness about the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), an international standard diagnostic classification for a wide variety of health conditions, including mental health. Kopelman said he makes his own diagnosis and thinks ICD definitions can be “political,” adding that ICD classifications of mental health “should not be used in a cookbook fashion” by untrained people. In another exchange, James Lewis suggested that the witness is a neuropsychiatrist, which concentrates on physical brain injuries and is not a forensic psychiatrist so could not be fully relied on to properly judge a prisoner’s mental health in the way a specialist could. Kopelman replied that he recalled being called by a solicitor who had told him, “There is an extradition trial in Wandsworth and James Lewis is keen to use your services,” leading to some laughter in court. The prosecution barrister then began citing various medical articles and asking if Kopelman had read them. “I didn’t think I was coming here for some kind of O level test,” he replied. Lewis then suggested that Assange was an intelligent man with a motive to exaggerate his mental health issues so as to avoid being extradited to the USA. He suggested that the WikiLeaks founder was “malingering,” and noted he was a regular reader of the British Medical Journal. The prosecutor also told the court that an alleged incident in Belmarsh prison which featured in the witness’ psychiatric report appeared nowhere in the prison’s record. Kopelman agreed that he had not been able to corroborate it and should have noted he only had Assange’s word that it had occurred. Prosecution also cited various reports by prison psychiatric staff, stating that Assange was fit to stand trial, to which Kopelman replied that Assange opens up more to him than them and said many of these reports represent little more than “a quick assessment on the way to court. ” The Professor also told the court that in his view Mr Assange was very reluctant to talk to many of the staff because he feared being put on constraint watch or isolation. Asked about a positive report on Assange’s mental health from a prison psychiatrist, Kopelman said this was before Assange was moved to a single cell and before he had examined him. Kopelman also suggested that the defendant avoided discussing some issues with prison staff out of embarrassment. He called another positive report the result of a “tick box exercise,” and said it could not be relied on. In a further exchange, Lewis told the witness, “I’m trying to change your mind, Professor. ” The witness asked, “About what?” The barrister replied “About your diagnosis. ” Kopelman’s response was, “I’m a psychiatrist, you’re a lawyer. ” The trial continues.

    "body": "2020/09/21 - Assange Evicted “On the orders of the President,” Court Told A prominent US supporter of President Trump said he had worked to evict Julian Assange from the Ecuadorian embassy, stated he wanted him executed and threatened a female commentator for informing the WikiLeaks founder about it, a court has heard. The testimony came in a sworn statement, from US commentator Cassandra Fairbanks, on day nine of evidence at a hearing in London which will determine if Assange will be extradited to the United States from the UK on charges of espionage and computer hacking. In the statement, which was read out in court, Fairbanks, who described herself as a “working journalist,” and a supporter of Donald Trump, said she was a member of a “direct message group,” with various other journalists, the former United States ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell, and a man called Arthur Schwartz. Schwartz, she said, was a wealthy Republican donor and an advisor to the President’s son, Donald Trump Jr. Fairbanks said that in October 2013, being sympathetic to Assange’s “plight,” she posted a video of an interview with his mother on the group, and ten minutes later received a telephone call from Schwartz, whom she described as “extremely angry. ” The aide, she said, told her to “stop advocating for Assange receiving a pardon,” because a pardon “isn’t going to f*cking happen. ” He also said “they wouldn’t be so forgiving now, and “brought up” her nine-year-old son, which she perceived as “an intimidation tactic. ” In the statement, she said that during further communications Schwartz “knew very specific things about the case,” and told her that the government was going to arrange to have Assange kidnapped from the Ecuadorian Embassy. When she replied, “that would be an act of war,” he had replied “not if they let us,” a prediction that later came true. Fairbanks also stated that she had visited Assange in London to tell him about this, and they had both taken precautions to avoid being overheard, such as playing a radio at high volume and speaking very quietly and close together and exchanging notes. Despite these precautions, she said, she was later told by Schwartz that he knew that she had warned Assange and therefore he could no longer “trust her with information. ” She said this showed there must have been US government surveillance on the Embassy. After the Wikileaks founder was arrested, the witness stated that she received text messages from Schwartz that said that Assange “deserved to die,” and that “everyone involved with WikiLeaks should be executed. ” Later, when she wrote a tweet questioning why the German ambassador to Washington was involved in the issue, he contacted her boss and “attempted to get me fired. ” In a later telephone call from Schwartz, which she recorded, she said the Republican donor was “ranting and raving,” and told her that Richard Grenell had helped to arrange for Assange to be removed from the Embassy “on direct orders from the President,” which she took to mean President Trump. Despite being given the opportunity by the trial judge, Vanessa Baraitser, to have the witness testify by video link so they could cross-examine and challenge her statements, barristers for the US government declined the opportunity.

    "body": "2020/09/21 - Journalist’s book gave away secret passcode, court hears Unredacted US government cables were released online after a Guardian journalist, David Leigh, published a book which contained the key to decrypt them, a court has heard. The claim came from a computer scientist, Professor Christian Grofthoff, who was giving evidence for the defence on the 9th day of evidence at the Julian Assange extradition hearing. In sworn testimony, Grothoff related that in 2010 and 2011 the main Wikileaks website was coming under sustained “denial of service attacks,” which involved remote computers in their thousands logging on to the site so as to overload its servers. In response, many people made copies of the site, “mirrors,” a few of which contained the cables, but added, “they were strongly encrypted. ” These, he said, “were useless without the key,” which was a long string of letters and numbers. The witness then told the that in early 2011, Leigh released a book, “WikiLeaks: Inside Julian Assange’s War on Secrecy” telling his story of working with Assange. One of the chapter headings, Grothhoff said, was simply the encryption key, which he had been given when he was working as a media partner of Wikileaks. In August 2011, a German newspaper Der Freitag published a story saying that there was a password going around the internet that could access the data. “People could now put two and two together, go over the WikiLeaks archive and decrypt the file,” he said. Asked if WikiLeaks could have taken any action to prevent this, he replied “no. ” The full archive was then published on various internet sites, including a searchable version on well known US-based website Cryptome, where he said it could still be found. Asked if the US government had prosecuted Cryptome over this, Grothoff replied to the best of his knowledge they had not. Cross-examining the witness on behalf of the US government, barrister Joel Smith suggested to Grothoff that Wikileaks themselves had given access to the data to over 50 organisations, including media organisations and non-governmental groups asking, if Wikileaks gave the password to too many people. Grothoff replied, “Well if you put it in a book, like David Leigh did, you give it to a lot of people. ” The prosecutor then put it to the witness that it was WikiLeaks itself who had encouraged people to build “mirror sites,” so they could not be totally knocked offline by a cyber attack. The witness said this was a usual strategy for organisations under a denial of service attack. Grothoff continued that often the best way to hide mirror websites which contained the files, was to build thousands of mirrors which did not contain it, making it almost impossible for someone searching for them to locate ones holding the data, “building a haystack,” as he called it. The prosecutor asked about an earlier release of some of the cables. The witness told the court that he had checked these saying that they were marked “unclassified. ” Smith asked, “Were they marked secret?” Grothoff replied, “unclassified documents are not usually secret. ” Under re-examination by defence counsel Mark Summers QC, Professor Grothoff told the court that according to Leigh’s own book, he had pressured Assange to give him the passcode to the decrypted files telling him, “You could be in an orange jumpsuit heading to Guantanamo Bay before you release them. ” Grothoff also testified that he had carried out an exhaustive search and had been unable to locate a single example of the code being released online before the Guardian journalist published it in his book.

In a written statement, solicitor Jennifer Robinson said she attended a meeting in August 2017 with Assange, then US Congressman Dana Rohrabacher, and conservative writer Charles Johnson at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. During this meeting Assange was made an offer of a full Presidential pardon if he would publicly say that his source of documents from the US Democratic Party was not Russia. Assange rejected the offer because Wikileaks has a policy of refusing to name their sources. This was not new information, having been reported in the media and mentioned during pre-hearings in the case, however today marked the first time the pardon offer has been given in sworn evidence before a court. Also new was the response from the US government lawyer, James Lewis QC, who told the court that the government agreed that the meeting mattered and that the offer was made, but “we do not accept the truth of it. ” In other words, the offer had been made but he did not accept that President Trump was aware of it or had authorised it.

    "body": "2020/09/18 - Journalists routinely rely on confidential sources, court hears On the 8th day of Julian Assange’s extradition hearing at London’s Old Bailey, the court heard from prominent New Zealand investigative journalist Nicky Hager. Hager told the court that journalists covering issues like the Iraq and Afghan wars had to use confidential sources, saying “we need classified information to inform the public. ” He continued, “There are some subjects which are so secret in their content that we cannot work on them to an adequate standard for the public unless we have confidential sources,” adding, “There is simply no realistic and effective alternative in order to hold people to account and aid democratic decision-making. ” Hager said that the WikiLeaks information allowed him to write about the “multi-layered nature” of the Afghan war, and said the war logs leaked by Wikileaks were “the most important material I have ever used in my life. ” Asked by defence counsel Edward Fitzgerald QC of his experience of working with Assange he replied, “Thoughtful, humorous and energetic, very different from the portrait painted in the media of this difficult man. He has dedicated himself to changing the world. In an era where secrecy was increasing, the digital era could be harnessed for good. ” Hager also testified that when he worked with Wikileaks he was “amazed” to see the level of care they were taking to redact information that might harm people, describing seeing “people working in silence for hours and hours” checking and redacting documents. Cross-examining on behalf of the US Government, James Lewis QC told the witness, “Mr Assange has not been charged with publishing any of the documents you relied on for your work. ” Lewis then asked the journalist, “Have you ever paid a government official to hack a computer?” to which Hager replied, “No, but you’re getting close to the point where I might say yes. ” Hager told the court that “journalists do not just sit passively and wait for information. We talk to our sources, we seek out sources. These are not just anonymous people, we have to protect them. ” The way that information has an effect on the world through news media &amp; public debate does not come in a neat segmented way as it might in the courtroom. So the war diaries, embassy cables, Guantanamo material, and Apache video affected the world as a whole, not as divisible parts. He compared the impact of Wikileaks’ Collateral Murder video to that of the video of the death of George Floyd saying it “electrified the world,” and led to significant changes in US policy in both Iraq and Afghanistan. The court then heard a written statement from Khaled El-Masri, a German citizen, who says he was arrested in Macedonia in 2003, tortured and then flown to a secret US military prison in Afghanistan and held there without trial. There, he said, he was routinely interrogated, beaten, strip-searched, sodomised, and subjected to other cruel forms of inhumane and degrading treatment for four months - accusations that the European Court of Human Rights ruled were true in 2012. The defence say that US diplomatic cables show that the US government put pressure on the German government not to prosecute the CIA agents involved. Mr El-Masri was due to give evidence by video link, but, after a legal argument, presiding judge Vanessa Baraitser decided that it would be sufficent for his statement to be read to the court and he need not appear. At this point Mr Assange spoke from the glass-fronted dock at the back of the court saying to the judge, “Madam I will not accept you censoring a torture victim’s statement to this court,” to which the judge replied, “You are well represented. ” The trial continues.

    "body": "2020/09/17 - Assange Conduct “Daily Routine” In US Media A US human rights lawyer has told a court that the actions for which Julian Assange is being prosecuted, namely publishing material the US government regards as classified, is “a daily routine in the US press, and is often encouraged by officials. ” Carey Shenkman, who was testifying on the seventh day of evidence in the extradition trial of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange at London’s Old Bailey, was giving evidence on the nature of the American Espionage Act, alleged breaches of which make up the bulk of charges against Assange. He told the court that the Act, passed in 1917 after America joined the fighting in World War I, “was born during “one of the most oppressive periods in US history,” saying it was “used to stop opposition to American participation, against Union leaders and socialist politicians. ” He described it as “extraordinarily broad,” and “one of the most contentious laws in the United States, saying that it “could even apply to someone in the UK retweeting something the US government considers classified. ” “It is really a political tool which has been used historically to prosecute dissenters and implement censorship. Most scholars are in agreement of this,” as this would be in conflict with the free speech provisions in the First Amendment to the US Constitution. On the specific issue of the charges against Assange being based on his publication of classified material, Shenkman said that despite eleven attempts he knew of, “there has never, in the century-long history of the Espionage Act, been an indictment of a U. S. publisher under the law for the publication of secrets. ” Cross-examining for the US government, Barrister Claire Dobbin questioned the witness’s impartiality saying he had at one point worked for an American law firm that represented Assange. Shenkman said that he had been at the firm, but in a very junior role just providing advice in international law, saying that “in the legal food chain, I was plankton. ” In a series of exchanges, the prosecution lawyer said to the witness “As you have offered an expert opinion about the Espionage Act I’m going to ask you some questions about US law if they are too difficult for you, tell me. ” Later Shenkman responded to a question by saying, “I don’t know why you are showing me documents and asking me to confirm what is written on the page, it seems like a waste of time. ” Asked by Dobbin why he had argued that the prosecution of Assange was political, Shenkman replied: “I never thought based on history we’d see an indictment that looked like this,” adding it is “truly extraordinary. ” Due to technical difficulties in the video link to the witness in America delaying proceedings, the testimony was unable to be completed today, so he was asked to return tomorrow to complete it.

    "body": "2020/09/17 - Assange was “insistent” about document redaction Julian Assange took a diligent and serious attitude to redacting names of people who could possibly come to harm over the release of the Iraq war logs, a court was told. The testimony came from Professor John Sloboda, the founder of the Iraq Body Count project which had used open-source information from the beginning of the invasion of Iraq by the US and its allies to calculate and publish estimates of how many civilians were being killed in the conflict. He told the court that in 2010 he collaborated with Wikileaks over the release of the Iraq war logs, over 400,000 day by day US military reports which, he said, had revealed over 15,000 deaths of non-combatants that he had previously been unaware of. He said that the importance of monitoring civilian deaths is that “it gives dignity for those who are killed and gives information that may reveal patterns and trends,” adding that the release of the documents led to a huge increase in worldwide awareness of the scale of civilian casualties during the invasion and subsequent occupation. Sloboda testified that as there were over 400,000 documents in the database of information and it would take “an army of people,” to manually check them, computer software was designed to automate the process. He said that the software would check the documents to check for non-English words and remove them, therefore ensuring no Iraqi names would be released to the public. The witness said many of WikiLeaks’ media partners were frustrated at the process, as it delayed their ability to publish stories, but Assange was insistent about it. Cross-examining for the prosecution, barrister Joel Smith suggested that Sloboda had no experience in the handling of classified material, and asked how many people had direct access to the raw Iraqi war log data. Sloboda replied he simply didn’t know, nor was he aware of what vetting procedures WikiLeaks used before giving people access to the material. The prosecution then suggested that despite the software names were released of Iraqi people who had given information or assistance to US military forces in Iraq, and asked Sloboda if it was not correct that “Mr Assange took a cavalier attitude to the publication of these names. ” Sloboda replied “No. ” Court then adjourned for the morning.

    "body": "2020/09/16 - Celebrated whistleblower defends Assange in court A famous Vietnam era whistleblower, 89-year-old Daniel Ellsberg, has told a court that he feels “a great identification,” with both Julian Assange and his source Chelsea Manning, who, he said, “were willing to suffer the risk of imprisonment or even death to get information to the American public. ” Ellsberg, a former US Marine officer who served with the US State Department in Vietnam during the war years, is best known for leaking a huge tranche of US government documents on the war to the New York Times in 1970, documents that showed that the government had been lying to the American people about the conflict from the beginning. He was later subject to prosecution and a series of attacks, including threats of violence from the Nixon administration, who called him “the most dangerous man in America. ” His revelations are now widely celebrated as helping to end the destructive conflict and he is the recipient of a number of international awards. Ellsberg testified that he rejected the idea that the Pentagon Papers were good and Wikileaks was bad, saying that many of the people who had vilified him for years were now praising him as a “patriot,” as a “foil against Assange and Edward Snowden. ” He said that Assange had political ideas of “sophistication and complexity,” many of which he agrees with and said his approach was “the exact opposite of reckless publication. ” Ellsberg told the court that Assange exposed what were clearly war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan and that he was shocked that while when he was serving Vietnam evidence of US war crimes would be classified top secret with very few people having access to it, while the Iraq and Afghan war logs leaked by Chelsea Manning were available on a system that over 100,000 people had access to, saying that, “torture and assassination have been normalised. ” He further told the court that during his prosecution in 1971 he was not allowed to tell a jury why he did what he did, and said that in US espionage cases matters of motive are not allowed not to be considered. “Julian Assange could not get a fair trial in the United States,” he concluded. In a fiery cross-examination exchange with the barrister representing the US government in the case, James Lewis QC, Ellsberg repeatedly denied people had been harmed by Wikileaks actions, a main plank of the US extradition case, saying, “I am still capable of being fooled by the government, like with WMD in Iraq - when they told me Wikileaks had blood on their hands I believed them, but 10 years later there is no evidence. ” The prosecution barrister called his statement “absolute nonsense,” saying that Osama Bin Laden had copies of Wikileaks documents when he was killed by US forces in 2011, and that the Taliban had publically said they were using the leaks to identify informers. Asked about people in Iraq and Afghanistan being forced to leave their homes after being named by WikiLeaks as haven given information to US military forces in those countries, Ellsberg replied, “None of these hundreds of threats appears to have been carried out, if they were I would have a very different attitude. ” He said that some people might have left their countries because of this and he regretted that, but added, “How many refugees have been caused in that region by US wars?” He told the court, “They are pretending to care about the people in this region when their policies have shown their absolute contempt for them over the last 19 years. ” Asked by Lewis, “What about the disappeared people in Iraq and Afghanistan?” the witness replied, “How do you know what happened when you can’t find them?” Ellsberg also said that “the US government could have stopped the sensitive names just being released just by giving the ones they were concerned about to Assange so he could redact them, instead “they did not lift a finger,” so they could still have the chance to prosecute him. They didn’t care,” he added, “they bear a heavy responsibility,” saying “even if it was true, it would be a small fraction of the number of people killed in US wars in the region. ” Asked if he himself had ever had a copy of the encrypted Wikileaks data, he replied “yes,” saying it was never published and he later “destroyed it with hammers. ” On re-examination for the defence, Ellsberg said that the Pentagon Papers he leaked “contained thousands of names,” including that of a CIA officer who had been involved in political assassination. He had not removed them so he could not be accused of “selectively editing” the documents, although he did hold back four folders of information on US diplomatic strategy as he did not want to undermine the chance of a negotiated peace settlement. He then concluded his evidence. The trial continues. Follow us on Twitter for live updates on the proceedings: @bridges4media "

    "body": "2020/09/16 - WikiLeaks cable release caused no harm to anyone, court hears A witness at the Julian Assange extradition trial has told the court that he knows of no incident involving harm to anyone that was caused by the WikiLeaks release of unredacted US government cables. John Goetz, a German investigative journalist testifying over a video link, was one of the media partners who worked with WikiLeaks to release information from the Afghan and Iraqi war logs, and a huge cache of US diplomatic papers. Addressing one of the main prosecution arguments against Mr Assange, namely that he acted irresponsibly and put the safety of people who had given information to the US military in Iraq and Afghanistan in jeopardy, Goetz described what he called a “robust,” process of removing names where their release may have put people in danger. Wikileaks was careful to keep unredacted documents safe, using secure servers and encryption, adding that WikiLeaks had invested time and money in screening the documents, a process he found “frustrating” at times as it delayed him in publishing stories. He also told the court that he had participated in a conference call with the US State Department who gave the reporters page numbers of the documents they had concerns over and that names were then removed from the ones they had mentioned. Asked about the eventual release of the unredacted government cables in 2011, Goetz told the court about a book by two Guardian journalists, David Leigh and Luke Harding, which the witness says revealed the password for an encrypted file hosted on Wikileaks secure servers. This allowed the information on “mirror sites,” to be decrypted and led to the website Cryptome publishing all of the information. Cross-examining, US government barrister James Lewis QC argued that Wikileaks published a week before Cryptome, which the witness said was incorrect. Responding to Lewis saying people had been put at risk by the release, Goetz replied by asking if the QC, “had a specific example of a sensitive name being released by WikiLeaks causing harm?” The prosecution QC says he will later. Asked by counsel if it was it true that his own Der Spiegel had condemned the release of the unredacted documents, Goetz replied “It did,” before adding after a pause, “But I wasn’t working there at the time. ” The trial continues.

    "body": "2020/09/15 - Julian Assange would not get a fair trial in the United States, a court has heard. The testimony, from long-serving American federal attorney Thomas Durkin, came on the 5th day of evidence in the WikiLeaks founder’s extradition hearing in London. Responding to questions, Durkin also said he strongly suspected that the prosecution was politically motivated and that the new indictment laid against Assange last month represented a “quantum leap,” in the seriousness of the case. Under questioning from defence counsel Edward Fitzgerald QC, Durkin told the court that in any US trial involving classified information lawyers can only access information in a secure setting for which they need security clearance, adding that he thinks it’s unlikely Julian Assange would be granted clearance by the US government. He also said that it was unlikely Assange’s lawyers would even be allowed to discuss classified information with their own client. On the issue of a possible sentence, Durkin, who is a former US Assistant District Attorney, said that if the defendant was convicted at trial he would expect him to receive between 38 and 45 years, agreeing that given Assange’s age this would amount to an effective whole life sentence, which he described as “draconian. ” He said that in US courts judges can take into account conduct a defendant is not even found guilty of and even issues he has been acquitted of, under the rule of “aggravation. ” Asked about the possibility of Assange pleading guilty and receiving a shorter sentence, the veteran lawyer replied that any plea bargain would mean Assange “fully cooperating,” with the US government which would involve him revealing all his sources of information. Cross-examined by prosecution lawyer James Lewis QC, who questioned his original testimony, the witness said it “was very clear to him,” that the Obama administration made a decision not to prosecute Mr Assange, saying he “doesn’t give a lot of credence,” to the argument it was not as there were very good reasons it was not taken up in the first place. He added that he was firm in the view that the Trump administration ordering the case to be re-opened was clearly a political decision. Asked how much he was paid to write the two defence reports he has produced, the witness replied “only if the judge redacts it, so my other clients don’t find out how little I’m charging in the case,” which led to laughter in court.

    "body": "2020/09/15 - Trump wants Assange jailed and kept quiet, court told. A witness at the Julian Assange extradition case in London has testified that the prosecution of Julian Assange is part of a Donald Trump effort to distract attention from the help WikiLeaks gave him during the election, “He wants to put Assange in jail and keep him quiet,” he told the court. Eric Lewis, a US attorney, was giving his third day of evidence in the case, which has been marred by numerous technical issues with his trans-Atlantic video link. The lawyer testified that he believed political pressure was put on US district attorneys to prosecute Assange, citing a New York Times article which quotes a “senior official,” saying just that. Asked if US prosecutors were not immune to political pressure, he read out a quote from President Trump, “I can do what I want with the Justice Department,” adding that current US Attorney General, Bill Barr, saw himself as “the hand of the President. ” Lewis told the court that “all the facts were out there by 2012,” no-one has ever said that the facts had changed, yet the Trump administration suddenly decided to prosecute. Asked by the prosecutor what qualifications he had in political affairs to make this statement, the witness replied that he has a degree in Public and International Affairs from Princeton University. Before being cross-examined by his namesake, James Lewis QC, who is acting for US government, the witness cleared up the mystery of why his feed was interrupted yesterday by an apparent clip from US Fox news suddenly appearing on the screen, which had led to social media claims that he had been hacked. The witness explained that he had been trying to access a document on his own computer and the clip had been embedded in it and had accidentally played. The prosecutor took issue with the witness’s earlier testimony that Mr Assange faced 175 years in prison if extradited to the United States on espionage charges over publishing classified government documents on the website he founded, WikiLeaks. The prosecution suggested that only a tiny percentage of offenders in America received the statutory maximum sentence, quoting US government sentencing guidelines in their support. They also cited the case of a former CIA agent, Jeffrey Sterling, an American lawyer and former CIA employee who was arrested, charged, and convicted of violating the Espionage Act for revealing details about an “Operation Merlin,” to journalist James Risen. Sterling, the prosecution said, had faced a sentence of 130 years, but after his conviction was only jailed for 42 months. Lewis replied, “But there has never been a case like this. ” The prosecution then moved onto to the issue of freedom of speech and national security, arguing that there were certain pieces of information that if leaked could jeopardise the security of the nation, Lewis replied that this applied to issues like publishing the date troop ships would be leaving port in wartime, but none of this applied to the actual information released by Wikileaks which, he said, exposed war crimes in both Iraq and Afghanistan. He said the reason the Obama administration had decided not to prosecute Assange was what he called the New York Times problem, the Justice Department then had concluded that there was no way to prosecute him for publishing classified information without the same theory being applied to many other journalists. However, he said, the Trump administration had ignored this in a rush to prosecute Assange. The witness also told the court that, if extradited, Mr Assange could face up to three years on remand before even facing a US court. The trial continues.

    "body": "2020/09/15 - Eight Members of the European Parliament are calling on the British government to improve access to Julian Assange’s extradition hearings, which continue at London’s Central Criminal Court this morning. The MEPs are among the 40 political and civil society observers who were granted permission to observe proceedings by videolink before that access was abruptly withdrawn on 7 September. Five of the eight Parliamentarians had travelled to London in February to attend the initial four days of hearings at Woolwich Crown Court. 25 Parliamentarians from different countries are monitoring the Assange case. Clare Daly MEP said: “I wrote to the UK Ministry of Justice and was given permission to join the official videolink to the courtroom. When I attempted to log in to monitor the proceedings on Monday last week, I was left sitting in a virtual waiting room for several hours. The same goes for my colleague Mick Wallace MEP. We found out the judge had revoked our access via Twitter. “A society with fair and impartial processes has nothing to hide. Access issues for court monitors are usually something that happen in countries with less of a tradition of the rule of law. We are forever hearing from Westminster about how the UK is better than that. We did not expect to have problems accessing a London courtroom. “We cannot as observers conclude anything about the fairness or impartiality of these hearings if we cannot be there. You would think the UK government would want to exclude any doubts about the impartiality of proceedings in as political a case as the Assange case. But unfortunately the Ministry of Justice does not seem to want anyone to be there. ” Amnesty International, Reporters without Borders, International PEN and Blueprint for Free Speech are among the civil society groups who were also impacted by last week’s removal of remote access. Full text of the joint statement follows below. We are members of the European Parliament from across the different political groups. We have been observing the extradition hearings of Julian Assange taking place in London. We wish to express our profound concern at how this case is being conducted. We were among 40 political and civil society monitors who were granted permission to observe proceedings by videolink after court space was restricted by pandemic guidelines. Now the court has overturned that decision. Our access has been revoked. We cannot monitor this case. We regretfully consider this an obstruction. This questions the legitimacy of these proceedings and throws doubt upon their outcome. A fundamental principle of any political system is that justice is not only done, but is seen to be done. Cases must be conducted in open court, where the public, civil society and the press can observe the operation of the law. This is all the more important for political cases where there may be wide-reaching effects on everyone’s civil and political freedoms. Civil society groups all over the world have unanimously raised concerns about the harmful consequences for freedom of expression if the prosecution of Julian Assange is successful. Public access to the hearings could not be more important but the Assange case is now effectively being decided in a closed court room. We call on the UK government to respect the most basic principles of justice and to provide for proper public access to this hugely significant case. We demand full and unrestricted access to the Assange case for political and civil society observers, the press and the public. And we demand justice for Julian Assange.

    "body": "2020/09/14 - Assange facing solitary confinement in the US, court told. If extradited to America, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange could face up to 175 years in prison and be subjected to draconian, “Special Administrative Measures,” a court has heard. Appearing as a witness for the defence at the fourth day of the hearing at London’s Central Criminal Court, US lawyer Eric Lewis said that the investigation of Mr Assange was the one of “the largest FBI operations in history,” and that it was, in his view, “an abuse of the criminal investigative power,” adding that until now, “No publisher has ever been successfully prosecuted for publishing national security information, never. ” The witness told the court that while the Obama administration had made a decision not to prosecute Assange in 2013, this had been reversed in 2017 after President Trump had taken office. He quoted a speech by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in which he said “Assange and his ilk, seek personal self-aggrandizement through the destruction of Western values. ” and that “that Assange was “a “narcissist” and “a fraud — a coward hiding behind a screen. ” Asked about “Special Administrative Measures,” Lewis said these included a prisoner being shackled, and not allowed to mix with anyone else, even exercise happens late at night so the prisoner remains isolated, he said. He also noted that a prisoner’s visits from lawyers were monitored by the US government saying, “Legal visits were monitored, recorded. We were told that audio wasn’t recorded but we weren’t certain, told that the team monitoring the recordings wasn’t the same as the prosecution team, but I’ve seen too many cases where that is not the case. ” Challenged by US government counsel about his knowledge of prison conditions the witness replied, “I spend more time in them than I care to remember, visiting clients,” He also noted he had a degree in Criminology from Cambridge University. Lewis noted that Assange’s case is unique, as he will be seen as a national security risk prisoner. He also said that while there was a process over when special administrative detention was imposed, “there is no way to challenge it. ” He also noted that Assange’s mental health makes him “particularly vulnerable,” to the effects of special administrative detention and that under that regime prisoners are not even allowed to watch news programmes, but only television chosen and approved by the prison authorities. Asked by the prosecution if these decisions could not be challenged, Lewis replied that he knew of no case in history that had managed to reverse a decision to put a prisoner on special administrative measures. Earlier, prosecution barrister James Lewis had made a complaint to the judge that he was being limited in the time he had been allowed for cross-examining defence witnesses, saying “this has never happened to him before in any court. ” The presiding judge Vanessa Baraitser replied by saying that there were 39 witnesses so she had no choice but to manage how much time each one takes. “That’s the end of the matter, Mr Lewis,” she said.

    "body": "2020/09/09 - A victory for the US government in the Assange case would “criminalise every journalist,” a press freedom expert has told a court. The testimony came in the third day of the Julian Assange extradition case After a delay due to technical issues, proceedings resumed at the Julian Assange extradition hearing this afternoon to hear evidence from a defence witness, Trevor Timm, via videolink from the USA. Timm, the founder of the Freedom of the Press Foundation told the court there have been numerous attempts by the US government to use the Espionage Act against journalists and none have ever been successful. He told the court that in his opinion this prosecution would mean that any journalist in possession of classified information could be arrested. He stated that if the charges being applied to Assange had been in place in the 1970s, Watergate reporters Woodward and Bernstein could have been thrown in jail, adding that if asking a source for classified information is espionage then the secure “dropbox” systems used by over 80 publications worldwide to encourage whistleblowers to send them information would also be illegally “soliciting classified information,” which is one of the charges against Assange. Timm told the court “I myself have advocated for leaks in cases where the US secrecy system is hiding abuse, corruption, or illegal acts and no-one has ever suggested I was committing a criminal act. ” Rising to cross-examine, James Lewis QC for the US Government, as he has with every defence witness so far, challenged Timm’s status as an “expert witness,” noting that his organisation had contributed $100,000 to Assange’s legal costs, so he could not be considered to be objective given this conflict of interest. Lewis then told the court that the prosecution “do not regard Julian Assange as a journalist. ” Timm replied that it is not up to the government to decide who is a journalist as “it is the right of everyone,” and that Assange was clearly “engaged in journalistic activities. ” The prosecution QC then pointed to a US Justice Department statement that Assange was not being prosecuted for publication of classified material, Timm replied that he made his judgement “based on the facts, not US government press releases. ” After counsel suggested to Timm he hadn’t seen all the evidence in the case, he replied that if there was secret evidence that had not been released he clearly hadn’t. Asked about the Wikileaks publication of unredacted names of Iraqi and US informants by WikiLeaks, Timm responded that he had never said WikiLeaks had perfect editorial judgement, any more than the Guardian or New York Times have, but if bad judgment is criminal many other publications would be under threat adding, “It shouldn’t be up to the US government to decide if an editorial judgment is criminal. ” Timm continued, “The 1st Amendment is not a balancing act, it also covers unpopular speech, or touches on subject matter that makes some us uncomfortable. ” Lewis asked the witness, “Are you a lawyer? What expertise do you have to give legal advice?” Timms replies that he graduated from law school in 2008 and was called to the New York Bar,” but later decided to run a non-profit organisation instead. The prosecution barrister quickly moved on. The witness was then asked why he was ignoring the fact that US prosecutors were bound to act in a non-political way, Timm replied that Trump’s hostility to journalists is well known and that a number of US prosecutors had refused to get involved in this case due to the 1st amendment issues involved. There was then a heated discussion when the defence rose to say that Lewis has reached his time limit of one hour. He vehemently objected to this and argued with both the defence and the judge, until judge Baraitser said he could have more time. The prosecutor then said that he “had finished anyway,” and ended his cross-examination. The trial continues. Follow us on Twitter for live updates on the proceedings: @bridges4media "

    "body": "2020/09/09 - 15,000 Iraqi civilian casualties exposed by WikiLeaks. Iraq War logs released by Wikileaks revealed 15,000 previously unknown civilian deaths, a court has heard. The evidence, from Professor Paul Rogers of Bradford University, came on the third day in the court hearing that will decide if WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange will be extradited to the United States on charges of espionage and computer hacking. Giving evidence for the defence Rogers said that the Iraq and Afghan war information not only revealed far higher civilian casualties than had previously been known but also, the witness said, “they exposed the fiction of success, the wars had gone wrong from the start,” adding that even today Wikileaks was an archive which is still widely used by scholars trying to understand both conflicts. Asked why he thought Assange was being prosecuted by the US government the professor said that “the Trump administration sees Wikileaks as a threat,” and that “this is an administration that sees everything from a political standpoint,” Rogers said. He also reminded the court that President Trump had even suggested the death penalty for Assange if he was found guilty. Cross-examining for the US government, James Lewis QC challenged Rogers’ claim that the prosecution of Assange was political, suggesting that US law did not allow District Attorneys to make decisions like this on anything other than a legal basis. The witness responded by saying that the political question was why this prosecution is happening now and not 8 years ago when the original acts occurred, stating “there was a political decision to reopen the investigation,” and adding, “it’s a question of timing. ” Challenged again by the prosecution QC, Rogers continued, “My view is that there was a strong political motive for this prosecution at this particular time. You can only understand this if you look at the history of the war over the last 20 years. ” Lewis then asked the witness why Trump would choose to prosecute someone who said during the election campaign he “loved Wikileaks,” the professor responded that a big trial of someone seen as a “public enemy,” might be an advantage to the administration. Court then adjourned for lunch The trial continues. Follow us on Twitter for live updates on the proceedings: @bridges4media "

    "body": "2020/09/08 - The Trump administration wanted a “head on a spike,” to deter future leakers and put pressure on the US Justice Department to prosecute Julian Assange a court has heard. The evidence, from US Professor Mark Feldstein, came on the second afternoon of Julian Assange’s extradition hearing at London’s Central Criminal Court, The Old Bailey. Feldstein told the court that in 2010 and 2011 the Obama administration was very eager to prosecute Wikileaks over the Iraq war documents it had released, however, they had been told by the Justice Department that not only would this be unconstitutional, but it would also create a precedent that could lead to many other journalists being prosecuted as it was, “too similar to the conduct of reporters at many other news outlets. ” Feldstein, a senior professor in the Journalism department at University of Maryland, was also asked by the defence about one of the charges Julian Assange is facing, that of soliciting classified information. “This paints journalistic activities in a very nefarious light,” he said, “we teach acquiring secret documents in journalism school,” adding that he himself has worked with contacts and sources to obtain information, “it’s standard practice. ” Asked about Assange helping Manning hide that she was his source, the witness says protecting a source is an obligation for reporters and that journalists have gone to jail rather than reveal them, and that governments often classify information because it is embarrassing to them, not because it is a threat to national security. Cross-examining on behalf of the US Government, James Lewis QC challenged professor Feldstein describing himself as an “unbiased expert witness,” saying that his written statement showed he had failed to quote parts of newspaper articles that contradicted his evidence. The professor replied, “The proof is in the pudding, they [the Obama administration] did not indict adding, “The Obama administration made a decision not to prosecute on 1st Amendment grounds and on the advice of officials. ” Lewis then raised a 2016 tweet from Wikileaks that said if Chelsea Manning was given clemency Assange would hand himself over, which, he said, shows Assange knew there were still active proceedings. Feldstein replied saying that he only saw that tweet last night and “it didn’t make much of an impression. ” Asked if he should have included it in his witness statement, the professor replied that he didn’t think Wikileaks would know about the grand jury situation at that time. Lewis then suggested that Feldstein had engaged in a “diatribe against President Trump, and would he not apologise?” The witness replied that he didn’t understand the question as it was a “double negative. ” “I’ll leave that there,” prosecution counsel replied. Prosecution counsel then put it to the Professor that the 1st Amendment did not allow journalists to hack computers just to get a story and that UK reporters had been jailed for hacking into telephones in the News of the World case. Feldstein agreed but added that it depended on the details. Lewis then asked the witness if a reporter should reveal the names of the third party in a situation where this might put them in danger, he replied, “no. ” The prosecutor then asked if there was any information a government might legitimately try and keep secret such as “troop movements in time of war, nuclear codes. ” The witness replied “yes,” adding that “the problem with yes and no answers is that Assange is being prosecuted under the espionage act which does not require that the USA shows any actual harm was done by the Wikileaks revelations. Prosecution counsel then put it to Feldstein that US prosecutors were not allowed to be motivated by politics. “That’s a bit naive,” Feldstein replied. Lewis then suggested that the Grand Jury system was a bulwark against political interference in prosecution decisions. Feldstein replied that much of the evidence on that remains secret and we will only know “when history delivers its verdict. ” Mr Lewis ended his cross-examination by asking the witness if he agreed with the theory that Trump is prosecuting Assange only to cover up his own involvement with Wikileaks, Feldstein says he doesn’t. Re-examined by the defence, Feldstein agreed it is very common for journalists to ask or solicit information from government employees, and that he had never heard of any previous prosecution on that basis, “it’s a chilling prospect to criminalise that…it’s criminalising journalism itself,” he replied, adding “Journalists are not passive stenographers…It can’t be right that the only way journalists can get information is anonymously in the mail. ” Feldstein said the nature of the indictment showed that the Trump administration “had journalism firmly in its sights. ” The evidence of Professor Feldstein then concluded and the court adjourned for the day.

    "body": "2020/09/08 - A secret US government assassination programme was halted thanks to information provided by WikiLeaks, a court heard today. The testimony came during the second day of the extradition hearing of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange at London’s Central Criminal Court, the Old Bailey. In his evidence, lawyer Clive Stafford Smith OBE said that as well as getting the Pakistani courts to stop the drone assassination programme, which he testified included targeting US citizens and journalists, information from WikiLeaks also allowed him to produce evidence to the US courts to allow innocent people to be released from detention in the US military facility in Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. The US lawyer also gave evidence about information revealed by WikiLeaks about what he described as torture carried out by US forces in Iraq, including “enhanced interrogation techniques,” which included razor blades being held to prisoner’s genitals and a technique which involved hanging detainees by the arms so their shoulders slowly dislocated. “It was like something out of the Spanish Inquisition,” he said. Responding for the US government, James Lewis QC suggested to Stafford Smith he had no experience in the classification of national security documents and the witness replied, “When I first went to see a British Man in Guantanamo, Moazzam Begg, he gave me 30 pages on why he was tortured and all of this was classified on the basis that revealing torture was a threat to national security. ” At this point Mr Assange tried to intervene from the glass-fronted dock at the rear of the court, leading to a short adjournment and the judge warning Assange if he repeated this conduct he might be removed from court and tried in his absence. In a series of heated exchanges the prosecution QC suggested to Stafford Smith that Mr Assange was not being prosecuted for publishing documents, but for putting the lives of US government informers in Iraq in Afghanistan at risk by releasing their names. The witness said, “that’s not how US trials work, the government could change the narrative with their first witness. ” He also noted that the US government indictment charged Assange with “wilfully communicating US government cables,” which, he said, could easily refer to publishing them. The prosecution QC told the court this was “simply misleading. ” Court then adjourned until 2 pm. "

    "body": "2020/09/07 - When proceedings resumed at 2pm, the defence asked for a further 30 minute adjournment to consult with their client about this morning’s rulings; there being no objections court rose until 2. 30pm. When court reconvened, Mark Summers QC, for the defence, rose and asked for his case to be postponed while new evidence from the US government is looked at by the defence, saying the defence “was simply not in a position to gather information about the new evidence,” adding that given Mr Assange was being held in custody this was not a decision they were taking lightly, but his client had not even seen the new indictment and they could only communicate with him via short telephone calls. Asked how long an adjournment he wanted, Summers said until January 2021. Responding for the US government, James Lewis QC said that this appeared to be a case of only asking for an adjournment after the defence team had lost this morning’s motion, stating that “we are here and we are ready to go. ” After a short adjournment, District Judge Vanessa Baraitser came back into court and ruled that the defence had had numerous opportunities to ask for an adjournment and had not done so, she therefore refused the application, a decision that may be subject to legal appeal given the situation. After all these months the case then heard from its first witness, Professor Mark Feldstein, by video from America. After declaring to tell the truth, Mr Feldstein’s testimony was halted by a technical issue with the videolink. When proceedings resumed Edward Fitzgerald QC for Mr Assange questioned Mr Feldstein about two reports he has written over the case. The witness told the court he graduated from Harvard and spent two decades as an investigative reporter, before gaining his PhD and becoming the head of broadcast journalism at the University of Maryland. Feldstein told the court he is not being paid for his evidence, adding that the leaking of classified information is “endemic,” in America, including by the US government itself which “leaks with abandon. ” The court heard that leaks expose corruption and misuse of power and “go back to the time of George Washinton. ” After telling the court leaks occur “on a daily basis,” the witness was asked if this meant there were prosecutions on a daily basis and Feldstein replied that to his knowledge no publisher had ever been successfully prosecuted in the United States for publishing leaked information. “There is no precedent in this matter,” he told the court, saying that he knew of no historical situation when a grand jury had brought charges against a publisher. At this point further technical issues with the video feed intervened and the court’s connection with America was lost. Court adjourned until tomorrow morning at 10am. "

    "body": "2020/09/07 - Hundreds of protesters gathered this morning outside London’s Central Criminal Court, the Old Bailey, to show their support for Julian Assange, who is facing extradition to the United States on charges of espionage and computer hacking relating to the release of documents on the Iraq and Afghan wars. The hearing, which began in February but was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, is expected to last between three and four weeks, with a number of defence witnesses, including Professor Noam Chomsky, preparing to give evidence to say that Mr Assange is being prosecuted for journalism and that the charges are politically motivated. After a first hour dominated by procedural matters, the presiding judge, Vanessa Baraitser, adjourned the case so the defence could take instructions in person from their client on a new indictment produced by the US government The court heard that Mr Assange had been formally re-arrested in the Old Bailey cells this morning after being driven in a white van from Belmarsh prison and that his defence team had not been given the opportunity to speak to him in person for six months. After the adjournment Mark Summers QC for Mr Assange rose to make a submission on the new charges filed by the US government, which he said the defence had only had sight of in the “last few weeks. ” “Without warning on the 24th June, 18 months after these proceedings started the US announced the new indictment, it is a curiosity that the US government was ready to go ahead in May, despite knowing this was coming,” Summers said. Summers also told the court that the defence had never been informed by the US government or the Crown Prosecution Service, but instead had learned about the new charges via a press release. The QC told the court that many of the new charges did not involve “dual criminality,” (the legal doctrine that one can only be extradited for an offence if it is a recognised crime in both countries. ) He also noted that other people had already been prosecuted and convicted for many of these alleged offences and that the source of many of these allegations, described only as “Icelandic teen,” had been convicted of fraud and attempting to impersonate Mr Assange. Summers then said to the judge, “these are the issues you should be contemplating, but you can’t, because they have come too late,” and that no explanation had ever been given for that. Summers then asked not to delay the case, as Mr Assange was in custody and did not want that, but to restrict the hearing to the evidence in the original indictment, otherwise, he said, the defence would not be in a position to make their case properly, “what’s happening here is wrong, unfair, and not in the interests of justice. ” Counsel for the US government, Joel Smith then rose to oppose the defence motion. He said the defence had been served the new charges in July but had not responded to the US government. He continued by saying the court must consider all offences put before it in an extradition hearing, and cannot “take a knife,” to the evidence, and quoted a number of legal precedents to support this view. He also argued that even if only part of a conduct was covered by “dual criminality,” this was still enough for the court to allow extradition, and the court did not have the jurisdiction to pick apart the charges. Summers responded for the Defence, “Wrong, wrong, wrong and wrong. ” Saying “we are not saying you can never lay a new indictment, but to do it six weeks before the hearing is unfair, it is just too late. ” He also argued that saying the court did not have jurisdiction would involve “reading the clause backwards, adding, “Mr Smith’s argument is ‘ha, ha ha, we can do what we want and you can’t do anything about it,’ that is wrong. ” The defence barrister then invited the judge to exclude the new evidence. Judge Vanessa Baraitser then gave her judgement, she said she offered the defence and adjournment to look at the new evidence, but they had not taken up the offer, she therefore refused the defence request. Court then rose for lunch. "

Fitzgerald added: “He has only this one chance to place his case before you and the fate that he faces if extradited is one that puts his very life at risk. Mr Assange will be facing a David and Goliath battle with his hands tied behind his back. ” He also noted that despite the ruling of the court at the last hearing, Assange did not get to meet his lawyers as planned in the holding cells at Woolwich Crown Court on April 22. He told the court that it was the defence view that “Bringing the defendant from the prison to the court is dangerous for both him and prison staff. ” He added that the prosecution itself agreed that it would not be safe to proceed at this stage. He then asked for the case to be adjourned until September. James Lewis QC for US Government then rose to say that due to the “extraordinary times,” he agreed with the defence motion. Judge Vanessa Baraitser then gave her ruling, she said it was key to avoid delay, especially when the defendant was in custody. The judge told the court that it was important to use innovative solutions to avoid the administration of justice being derailed by the current health emergency. She said however, that as it was impossible to physically present defendants in court, she would postpone the 18 May date for the second part of the hearing. She said the next three week period available at Woolwich Crown Court would be from 2 November. The defence asked for time to consult his client, the court then adjourned until 4 May at 10am "

    "body": "2020/02/27 - The first phase of the extradition hearing of Julian Assange ended today with a row on whether he was receiving a fair trial. Defence counsel Mark Summers QC, told the presiding judge, Vanessa Baraitser that Assange being held in a sealed, glass-fronted dock at the back of the court was hindering Mr Assange’s ability to participate in the case. As we reported yesterday, Assange told the court yesterday, “I am as much a participant in these proceedings as I am at Wimbledon. ” Summers said that this kind of “secure dock” did not even exist 20 years ago, and noted that almost every other country, including the United States of America had dispensed with it. He said that as the dock was located at the rear of the court, the lawyers could not see their client see him unless they look around, and even then it was difficult to communicate through such a physical barrier. He also said it was “impossible to speak confidentially,” to his client while in the dock, as he is flanked by two guards, the dock contains microphones, and representatives of the US government are sitting only a few feet away. The defence barrister proposed that Assange be allowed to sit with his legal team and that he would still be in custody, adding “You can even be in custody while enjoying the delights of the court canteen, the issue is whether he is being properly supervised. ” He then gave a number of examples of vulnerable defendants being allowed to sit with their legal support team. “It’s not unusual,” he said. Assange then stood up in the dock and said, “The problem is I’m not able to get representation. ” Judge Baraitser then told him to “keep quiet and speak through his lawyers. ” He replied, “that’s the problem, I can’t. ” The prosecution said they were neutral on the matter and had nothing to add. The judge then rejected the application saying that she would allow more breaks in proceedings to allow Assange and his lawyers to consult. Earlier this morning, the court had heard further argument on the issue of if someone could be deported for a “political offence. ” While the UK/US extradition treaty itself says they cannot, the prosecution say that the 2003 UK extradition act does not mention it, and this is what the judge should consider. Edward Fitzgerald QC, for the defence, told the court that it could not just ignore the working of the treaty saying, “We’re in a pretty strange Alice in Wonderland world where the treaty that controls and gives rise to the request, supposedly has nothing to do with the legality of it, it’s very strange,” adding: “it is generally accepted worldwide that people should not be extradited for a non-violent offence of a political nature. ” Judge Baraitser has said she would reserve judgement on the matter. The four-day hearing then adjourned, to resume in May when the legal arguments we have had so far will be replaced by around four weeks of witnesses and evidence. The case continues "

    "body": "2020/02/26 - Julian Assange’s access to his legal team is being curtailed, he told the court today. After presiding judge Vanessa Baraitser asked the defence team if their client was able to continue, Assange himself stood up to speak in the enclosed, glass-fronted dock. He said that he could not speak to his legal team confidentially as he is flanked by guards and “I have very little contact with my lawyers. ” He added, “There’s been enough spying on my lawyers in this case already,” and, “I am as much a participant in these proceedings as I am at Wimbledon. ” The judge then told the defendant he was not allowed to speak in court and would have to communicate through his legal team. She then adjourned the case so this could be done. When proceedings resumed, chief defence barrister Edward Fitzgerald QC asked the court to consider of it would be possible for Assange to leave the dock and sit with his legal team, saying that the accused was not even being allowed to pass notes to his team. He continued, “He is a gentle man with an intellectual inclination, he is no threat sitting with us. . no threat to anyone. ” With the prosecution counsel, James Lewis QC, saying he was neutral on the issue, Judge Baraitser said she would hear submissions from the defence tomorrow morning to decide the issue. This is not the first time the level of security around Assange, an accepted non-violent offender, has raised concerns in court. On Tuesday, it heard that on Monday alone he had been strip-searched twice, handcuffed 11 times and placed in 5 different holding cells. The case continues. "

    "body": "2020/02/26 - Proceedings resumed this morning with the court hearing legal submissions on the issue of whether Julian Assange’s extradition should be blocked on the basis the offences he is accused of being “political in nature. ” Edward Fitzgerald QC, for the defence, opened by reminding the court that the 2007 extradition treaty between the UK and the USA specifically excludes political offences, adding “this is an essential and fundamental protection which the USA puts in every one of their extradition treaties. ” The barrister went on to tell the court that while it was true that the UK government passed an Act of Parliament in 2003 that does not contain political crime defence, it was still in the actual treaty between the UK and the USA passed in 2007 and was a “key part of international law. ” At this point the judge, Vanessa Baraitser intervened and asked if it was not true that this court’s job is to implement English domestic law, not international law? Fitzgerald replied that the court must consider both international law and the European Convention on Human Rights and that not doing so would be an “abuse of process. ” Counsel then told the court that the US writes the political defence into every extradition treaty it signs “because they don’t want their own citizens deported, but when they want someone extradited to them it suddenly doesn’t matter?” Adding that Assange is charged with purely political offences, “the treaty says you cannot be extradited for a political offence, for the court to sit and do nothing would be strange. ” After a short break, proceedings resumed with Mr Fitzgerald going over a number of legal precedents for his position that no-one should be extradited for a political offence, going back as far as the Hungarian uprising of 1848. He suggested that a political offence is an offence against the state itself. He says espionage, finding out information the state wishes to keep secret, is a “pure political crime,” and all of the 18 charges against Assange were, or were related to espionage. Noting “treason” comments by Republican lawmakers on Assange, defence counsel said: “It’s hard to understand how he could commit treason when he is not a citizen of the United States. ” Court then rose for lunch, with lawyers for the United States Government expected to respond to these points this afternoon. The case continues. "

    "body": "2020/02/25 - Chelsea Manning “acted through conscience” Wikileaks dealt responsibly with Afghan/Iraq leak Assange told Manning “Curious eyes never run dry. ” Case halted early as Assange suffers difficulties in concentrating Court two at Belmarsh Magistrates Court resumed just after 2 pm to hear further submissions from defence counsel Mark Summers QC. Summers continued to hammer what he said were inaccuracies in the US government’s extradition request.  On the charge that Julian Assange had helped former US soldier Chelsea Manning crack a password to a secure system used by the US military to gather information, Summers said that in fact that the system concerned at that time did not require a password to access. Turning to the conversation, through a messaging app, between Assange and Manning about passwords, Summers told the court that soldiers in Manning’s unit often wanted cracked administrator passwords so they could install games and music on their computers. She was seen as a technical expert, even being asked by superiors to install software they wanted. Defence counsel noted that just before the exchange Manning’s computer had been reformatted, so, “to get movies and games back she’d need another crack at the password. ” Turning to the accusation that Assange had “solicited,” Manning into providing information and then leaked it in an irresponsible manner so putting in danger those helping the US military in Iraq and Afghanistan, Summers said “Assange went through what Manning leaked over Iraq, which included the US military handing over detainees to torture squads and the murder of civilians. ” He noted that the former soldier has always said she was moved by her conscience to leak the information, not at the urging of the Wikileaks founder. Turning to the daily “war reports,” for Iraq, also leaked by Manning, the defence barrister says these materials were “non-sensitive,” and “historic. ” They would, he said, be of no operational use to an enemy after 72 hours or so and generally contained no names. “There was no danger to any source in the release of these documents,” Summers said, adding to the judge “this is the kind of information you think they [the prosecution] would have told you. ” Summers then told the court that when Wikileaks published the Afghan War Diaries they held back around 20% of the data so as to protect people’s identities. 15,000 documents were held back for “harm minimisation,” the defence counsel said noting again that is the sort of matter the prosecution might have mentioned during their opening yesterday. He concluded his statement by saying, “the misrepresentations of the US government in this case amount to clear evidence of bad faith. ” James Lewis QC, who is representing the US government then rose to respond. He said many of the points raised by the defence were “no more than innuendo,” questioning if Chelsea Manning’s testimony could be trusted. He said much of what Manning says is “self-serving,” and cannot be relied on, adding “she has been consistently been trying to help him [Assange]. ” He also noted that during another conversation with Assange, Manning had said she had no more information, to which Assange replied, “Curious eyes never run dry” - which Lewis suggested was “evidence of solicitation. ” At this point, the presiding judge, Vanessa Baraitser, paused the case and asked the defence team if Mr Assange was ok to continue. Solicitor Gareth Peirce spoke to the defendant and told the court, “Mr Assange is struggling, he is finding it difficult to concentrate and cannot speak to his legal team. ” The judge then adjourned for the day.

Mark Summers QC, another member of the defence team, then rose to argue that the prosecution case that Assange had solicited material from former US soldier Chelsea Manning and had then recklessly put lives at risk by releasing it was “Lies, lies and more lies. ” The QC said that the released cables had a clear public interest, including US spying on UN diplomats, extra-judicial killings etc, says their release has “changed the world. ” Manning, the court was told, had taken full responsibility for the release of the information at her court-martial, and while Wikileaks did have requests for information on its website, the idea that they asked for US diplomatic cables was “complete fantasy. ” Summers also gave the court a very different version of the release of the unredacted version of the cables from what the court heard from the US government yesterday. He suggested that for nine months after the data had been passed on, Wikileaks worked with five media partners to edit out anything from the cables that could put lives at risk. Summers said that even the US State Department was co-operating with the process, holding a conference call with a German media outlet to discuss how this could be done. The court was told that this went wrong when two Guardian journalists, Luke Harding and David Leigh, published a book which contained the password to the database. This led to the uncensored information being published on Cryptome, a US-based site. As Summers noted, the information is still on the site and Cryptome has never faced prosecution. Defence Counsel also told the court that when the password disclosure was discovered Assange had personally phoned the White House to warn them, only to be told to call back “in a few hours. ” Summers then said, ““The US government knows all this, but then they send documents to the court saying Assange ‘recklessly put lives at risk’” He also rubbished claims that Assange had helped Manning to hack a password to gain access to information, noting that she already had full access and, it was shown at her court-martial that this was tracked by IP address, not by a password. Summers concluded: “Is this extradition request a fair reflection of what is known by the US government? The answer is blatantly no. ” The case continues "

    "body": "2020/02/24 - While this morning belonged to the US government to put its an argument for the extradition of Julian Assange, this afternoon belonged to the defence, as Edward Fitzgerald QC put the case for him not to be sent to the USA to face trial on espionage and computer misuse charges. The grey-haired defence barrister told the court that the charges against Assange were not about criminal justice, but were “due to underlying political motives of the US government. ” He said that he would produce evidence that Fitzgerald says that US President Donald Trump met with FBI Director James Comey and told him he wanted a “head on a pike,” to discourage leakers and whistleblowers. “This is the real motive for this prosecution,” he said, adding, “Julian Assange has been made an example of. ” He continued: “This prosecution is not because of any new facts, it was because it was politically expedient. He also noted that recent comments by senior US administration figures have, in his opinion, seriously prejudiced Assange’s right to a fair trial. Fitzgerald then told the court that he had a witness that would confirm a US Congressman, and ally of President Trump, Dana Rohrabacher, had offered Assange a full pardon on all charges if he would only say that the Russsian government was not involved in the leak of documents to Wikileaks during the 2016 election. This, counsel said, was “political extortion, threatening Assange with years in prison if he would not do Trump a political favour. ” Fitzgerald also said he would be presenting evidence that says US intelligence was spying on Assange while he was in the Ecuadorian embassy, including filming and recording discussions with his legal team. He added that a witness would be testifying that ““more extreme measures,” to deal with Assange were discussed, including “kidnapping and poisoning. ” Summing up, the defence barrister said of Assange: “He is anti-war, anti-imperialist, for free speech and an open society. Those beliefs inevitably bring him into conflict with powerful states, and have led to him being called a ‘terrorist. ” He said that there was no evidence anyone was damaged or hurt due to the Wikileaks releases, concluding: “Julian Assange faces life in prison for publishing true information that was in the public interest. . if truth becomes treason we are all in trouble. ” The case continues.

    "body": "2020/02/24 - Hundreds gathered outside a London court today to protest at the first day of the extradition hearing of Julian Assange, with their chants of “Free Assange,” fully audible inside the hearing room. The United States Government is demanding that the Wikileaks founder be sent to Virginia to stand trial for conspiring to gather classified information, revealing the names of confidential informers and conspiring with former soldier Chelsea Manning to break a secret password. As Assange sat impassively in the glass-fronted dock, James Lewis QC, representing the US government told the court that extradition was being sought for “conspiracy to steal and hack into a Department of Defence computer system,” adding that, “ This is a crime, and reporting is not an excuse for criminality. ” He continued by arguing that the release by Wikileaks of uncensored US diplomatic cables had put at-risk people who had provided US intelligence with information during military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and that revealing the locations of “sensitive US military sites,” could have hindered the “fight against terrorism. ” Lewis then told the court “ it is not for the US government to show there was any actual harm,” to confidential sources before also alleging that documents from Wikileaks were found at the home of the founder of Al-Qaeda, Osama Bin Laden when it was raided by American troops in 2011. Lewis then told the presiding judge, District Judge Vanessa Baraitser, that he wanted to address what he described as the defence “hyperbole” that the WikiLeaks founder could be sentenced to up to 175 years in prison in the US “Sentencing is a function of the trial court not the function of the charging authority. Indeed, the equivalent offence in the UK would carry the equivalent sentence,” he added stating that the average jail term for similar offences in the US was between 40 and 60 months. He also argued that the court had no jurisdiction to even consider the “abuse of process,” submissions that we expect to be made by Assange’s defence team later in the case. Lewis also told the court that despite the WikiLeaks founder not being a US citizen, he can be prosecuted under American security laws for “aiding and abetting” a US citizen in doing so, in this case, “conspiring,” with former US intelligence officer Chelsea Manning. Asked by the judge if they accepted this, Edward Fitzgerald QC for the Defence rose to say the extradition offence is not valid as journalistic activity is protected under article 10 of the European Human Rights Act. The prosecution pointed on to the UK 1989 Official Secrets Act, which was passed after a civil servant, Clive Ponting, was acquitted of an offence after arguing the public had a right to know about the sinking of an Argentinian warship, the General Belgrano in 1981. The new act removed any “public interest” defence in revealing security or intelligence matters. The QC said that that as there is no public interest defence in the Official Secrets Act if a newspaper published official secrets they are guilty of an offence no matter what the purpose. The European Human Rights Act “does not apply,” he said, adding “Otherwise could just publish what you wanted. ” The US government is expected to conclude their opening remarks later today, with the defence then presenting its opening statement. The case continues "
